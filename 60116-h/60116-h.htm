<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_WEST_SIDE_STUDIES">PREFACE TO WEST SIDE STUDIES</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the summer of 1912 the field work was completed
for the West Side studies published in these
volumes. They are part of a wider survey of
the neighborhood which it was proposed to make
under the Bureau of Social Research of the New York
School of Philanthropy with funds supplied by the
Russell Sage Foundation. Dr. Samuel McCune Lindsay,
director of the School, and I were in charge of the
Bureau and together planned the scope and nature of
the inquiry. To his inspiriting influence was due in
large measure the enthusiasm and harmonious work of
our staff.</p>

<p>The investigators in the Bureau were men and women
who had been awarded fellowships by the School of
Philanthropy. There were junior fellowships, given for
one year only, and intended to provide training in
social research for students without much previous
experience, who were required to give part of their time
to class work and special reading. There were also
senior fellowships given to more advanced students who
devoted full time to investigation. After two years’
work it was felt that to carry out the original plan
satisfactorily would require the employment of a permanent
staff of investigators who were well trained
and equipped. The School, therefore, decided not to
carry the survey further and reorganized the Bureau
on a different basis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

<p>This brief account of the Bureau is needed to explain
the special topics dealt with in these volumes. The
personal qualifications of the investigators as well as
the available opportunities for investigation necessarily
determined the choice of subjects.</p>

<p>A word must be said, too, as to the selection of this
particular West Side district of New York City. These
80 blocks which border upon the Hudson River, between
Thirty-fourth and Fifty-fourth Streets, contrast
sharply with almost all other tenement neighborhoods
of the city. They have as nearly homogeneous
and stable a population as can be found in any
part of New York. The original stock was Irish and
German. In each generation the bolder spirits moved
away to more prosperous parts of the city. This left
behind the less ambitious and in many cases the wrecks
of the population. Hence in this “backset” from the
main current of the city’s life may be seen some of the
most acute social problems of modern urban life&mdash;not
the readjustment and amalgamation of sturdy immigrant
groups, but the discouragement and deterioration
of an indigenous American community.</p>

<p>The quarter which we studied is strangely detached
from the rest of the city. Only occasionally an outbreak
of lawlessness brings it to public notice. Its old
reputation for violence and crime dates back many generations
and persists to the present day. So true is this
that we considered it essential at the beginning of our
undertaking to ascertain the main facts of the district’s
development. To Otho G. Cartwright was assigned
the task of collecting this material. He did not
make an exhaustive inquiry, but obtained from
reliable sources sufficient information to give the historical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
background of life in the district today. His
work serves as a general introduction to the more
intensive studies which follow.</p>

<p>The study of juvenile delinquency, Boyhood and
Lawlessness, shows clearly the need of special intimate
knowledge of social phenomena if their underlying causes
are to be understood. It describes the inadequacies of
the present system: the innumerable arrests for petty
offenses or for playing in the streets, and the failure
of the police to bring the ringleaders into court. All
this seems so unreasonable to the neighborhood and has
so often aroused its antagonism that the influence of
the Children’s Court is seriously undermined. In fact,
the fathers and mothers of its charges look upon it
only as a hostile authority in league with the police,
while its real purpose is entirely hidden from them.
The evidence is clear, too, that both parents and community
have failed to understand and provide for the
most elementary physical needs of the boys.</p>

<p>The same tragic lack of opportunity and care characterizes
the lives of the girls. Ruth S. True’s portrayal
of these lives in The Neglected Girl rests upon
close personal acquaintance with a special group of girls
who, though they were not brought up on charges in the
Children’s Court, yet were without question in grave
need of probationary care.</p>

<p>In neither of these two studies was it possible to suggest
adequate remedies for the evils described. It is
true that steps have already been taken by the
Children’s Court to make its probation staff more
effective. But the more fundamental need for modification
of the conditions of the child’s life and environment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
has still to be pondered. Clearly it is not the
child alone who needs reformation.</p>

<p>Similarly, Katharine Anthony’s report, Mothers Who
Must Earn, reveals much more than isolated cases
of hardship and suffering due to accident or death.
She has studied the social and economic causes which
compel the mother of a family to become a wage-earner,
and the consequences of such employment for her home
and family. The occupations where her services are in
demand were carefully examined. The underpayment
of many of the husbands, which drives their already
overburdened wives into wage-earning, is perhaps the
most significant fact disclosed. To relieve such severe
economic pressure there is certainly need of more radical
and far-reaching readjustments than can be effected
by any one remedial measure. Relief giving is at best
only a temporary stop-gap. This is rather a labor
problem of the utmost gravity, affecting whole classes
of underpaid laborers.</p>

<p>Indeed, if there is any one truth which emerges from
these studies, it is the futility of dealing with social
maladjustments as single isolated problems. They are
all closely interrelated, and the first step in getting
order out of our complexities must be knowledge of
what exists. To such knowledge these studies aim to
make a contribution. They are not intended to prove
preconceived ideas nor to test the efficacy of any
special remedies. They aim to describe with sympathy
and insight some of the real needs of a neglected quarter
of our city&mdash;“to hold, as it were, the mirror up to
nature.”</p>

<p>The various investigators who took part in the inquiry
are given herewith: Edward M. Barrows, Clinton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
S. Childs, Eleanor H. Adler, Beatrice Sheets, and
Ruth S. True contributed to the study of the West
Side boy, here published under the title Boyhood and
Lawlessness. Thomas D. Eliot, a junior fellow, also
assisted. Associated with Ruth S. True in the study
of the neglected girl, were Ann Campion and Dorothy
Kirchwey. All three shared the responsibility of
conducting the Tenth Avenue club for the observation
of the girls described in their report. The volume
Mothers Who Must Earn is the result of work done by
Katharine Anthony, who was assisted in her field work
by Ruth S. Waldo, a junior fellow.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>In the fall of 1912 practically the whole staff at that
time employed devoted two months’ time to inspection
of the industrial establishments of the district, under
authority of the New York State Factory Investigating
Commission. The results were published as Appendix
V, to Volume I, of the Commission’s Preliminary
Report, 1912.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to many persons who gave unstintedly
of their time to the various investigators. Our
indebtedness is especially great to the staff of the Clinton
District office of the Charity Organization Society,
who brought us in touch with many families in their
care, and through their varied experience helped us in
interpreting many aspects of neighborhood life. Among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
other agencies, Hartley House was particularly generous
in making us acquainted with its Italian neighbors
and in giving us the opportunity to visit them in their
homes. The teachers of various local schools should
also be mentioned with appreciation for the help they
gave us in many ways.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> the Bureau of Social Research began, early
in 1909, an investigation of the Middle West
Side, it was soon realized that of all the problems
presented by the district, none was more urgent and
baffling, none more fundamental, than that of the boy
and his gang. His anti-social activities have forced him
upon public attention as an obstruction to law and
business and a menace to order and safety. Because
of this lawlessness and because of New York’s backwardness
in formulating wise preventive measures to
meet it, a special study of the West Side boy was begun.</p>

<p>In order to gain an intimate knowledge of neighborhood
conditions which affect the boy, two men workers,
Edward M. Barrows and Clinton S. Childs, went to
live in the district, the former remaining for nearly
two years. During their residence they came in close
touch with several gangs and clubs of boys. Their
experiences, while they yielded some of the most vital
and significant material of our study, did not lend themselves
to statistical treatment; they were not recorded
in the form of family and individual histories, but as a
running day-by-day diary, which formed the basis of
the chapters dealing with the activities and the environment
of the boys.</p>

<p>Since the West Side boy, either through personal contact
or through association with gang leaders, is
inseparable from the Children’s Court, attention was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
naturally drawn to the extent and the result of his
relation to this institution. For this reason the Bureau
made a special study of 294 boys<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> selected from the
district with particular reference to their delinquency
and their court records.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Of these boys 28 were under twelve years, 71 more
were fourteen, and 102 more were under sixteen. In
view of these significant facts it became necessary not
only to examine the environment of the West Side boy,
but also to estimate the influence of the Children’s
Court and other institutions upon him when toughness,
truancy, gambling, or other temptations had
carried him over the brink into real delinquency. That
society should feel itself compelled to resort continually
to the arrest and trial of children is in itself a confession
of defeat. But when even these resources fail, it
becomes imperative to analyze all the factors in the
situation; to set the destructive and the constructive
elements over against each other, and to determine the
chances which the boy and the various public and private
agencies organized to regenerate him have of
understanding one another.</p>

<p>To many the study may serve to show at their doors
a world undreamed of; a world in which, through causes
which are even now, removable, youth is denied the
universal rights of life, liberty, and happiness. To the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
court it may be of use in throwing light into dark places
and in showing where old paths should be abandoned,
as well as in offering suggestions at a critical period in
its history.</p>

<p>And, indeed, every suggestion which will tend to
lessen the troubles of the Middle West Side is peculiarly
needed. The whole community&mdash;from molested property
owners to the most disinterested social workers&mdash;are
agreed that the worst elements rule the streets and
that neither police nor court authority succeed in enforcing
decency and order. And the center of the problem
is the boy, for in him West Side lawlessness finds
its most perennial and permanent expression.</p>

<p>The aim of this study, therefore, is to trace the principal
influences which have formed the West Side boy;
to consider some of the means which have heretofore
been employed to counteract these influences; and to
picture him as he is, exemplifying the results of circumstances
for which not he but the entire community is
responsible.

<span class="large">HIS BACKGROUND</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> influence of environment on character is
now so fully recognized that no study of
juvenile offenders would be complete without
a consideration of their background. In the lives
of the boys with whom this study deals this background
plays a very large part. One-third of the 241 families
studied, 82, are known to have lived in the district
from five to nineteen years, and a somewhat larger
number, 88, for twenty years or more.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> This means
that the boys belonged almost completely to the neighborhood.
Most of them had lived there all their lives,
and many of them always will live there. If they are
to be understood aright, this neighborhood which has
given them home, schooling, streets to play in, and
factories to work in must also be pictured and understood.</p>

<p>In New York, owing perhaps to the shape of the
island, the juxtaposition of tenement and mansion is
unusually frequent. Walk five blocks along Forty-second
Street west from Fifth Avenue and you are in
the heart of the Middle West Side. The very suddenness
of the change which these blocks present makes
the contrast between wealth and poverty more striking
and enables you to appreciate the particular form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
taken by poverty in this part of the city. Eighth
Avenue, at which our district begins, looks east for
inspiration and west for patronage. It is the West
Sider’s Broadway and Fifth Avenue combined. Here
he promenades, buys his clothes, travels up and down
town on the cars, or waits at night in the long queue
before the entrance to a moving picture show. The
pavement is flanked by rows of busy stores; saloons
and small hotels occupy the street corners. There is
plenty of life and movement, and as yet no obvious
poverty. On Saturdays and “sale” days, the neighborhood
department stores swarm with custom.</p>

<p>Ninth Avenue has its elevated railroad, and suffers
in consequence from noise, darkness, and congestion of
traffic. Here the storekeeper can no longer rely on his
window to attract customers. He knows the necessity
of forceful advertising, and his bedsteads and vegetables,
wooden Indians and show cases, everywhere encroach
upon the sidewalk. On Saturday nights “Paddy’s
Market”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> flares in the open street, supplying for a few
hours a picturesqueness which is greatly needed. Poor
and untidy as this avenue is, the small tradesmen who
live in it profess to look down on their less prosperous
neighbors nearer the river.</p>

<p>West of Ninth Avenue tenements begin and rents
decrease. At Tenth Avenue, where red and yellow
crosstown cars swing round the corner from Forty-second
Street, you have reached the center of the West
Side wage-earning community, and a street which on
a bright day is almost attractive. Four stories of red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
brick tenements surmount the plate glass of saloons
and shops. Here and there immense colored advertisements
of tobacco or breakfast foods flame from
windowless side walls, and the ever-present three brass
balls gleam merrily in the sunlight. But the poverty
is unmistakable. You see it in the tradesman’s well-substantiated
boast that here is “the cheapest house
for furniture and carpets in the city.” You see it in
the small store, eking out an existence with cigars and
toys and candy. You see it in the ragged coats and
broken shoes of the boys playing in the street; in the
bareheaded, poorly dressed women carrying home their
small purchases in oil-cloth bags; in the grocer’s amazing
values in “strictly fresh” eggs; in the ablebodied
loafers who lounge in the vicinity of the corner saloon,
subsisting presumably on the toil of more conscientious
brothers and sisters. And in one other feature besides
its indigence Tenth Avenue is typical of this district.
At the corner of Fiftieth Street stands the shell of what
was once a flourishing settlement, and beside it a
smaller building which was once a church. Both, as
regards their original uses, are now deserted. Both are
a concrete expression not merely of failure, but of failure
acquiesced in. These West Side streets are more
than poor. They have ceased to struggle in their
slough of despond, and have forgotten to be dissatisfied
with their poverty.</p>

<p>Eleventh Avenue is much more dirty and disconsolate.
In its dingy tenements live some of the poorest
and most degraded families of this district. On the
west side of the avenue and lining the cross streets are
machine shops, gas tanks, abattoirs, breweries, warehouses,
piano factories, and coal and lumber yards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
whose barges cluster around the nearby piers. Sixty
years ago this avenue, in contrast to the fair farm land
upon which the rest of the district grew up, was a
stretch of barren and rocky shore, ending at Forty-second
Street in the flat unhealthy desolation of the
Great Kill Swamp. Land in such a deserted neighborhood
was cheap and little sought for, and permission
to use it was readily given to the Hudson River Railroad.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Today the franchise, still continued under its
old conditions, is an anomaly. All day and night, to
and from the Central’s yard at Thirtieth Street, long
freight trains pass hourly through the heterogeneous
mass of trucks, pedestrians, and playing children; and
though they now go slowly and a flagman stands at
every corner, “Death Avenue” undoubtedly deserves
its name.</p>

<p>De Witt Clinton Park, the only public play space in
the district, lies westward between Fifty-second and
Fifty-fourth Streets. It is better known as “The
Lane” from days, not so long ago, when a pathway
here ran down to the river, and on either side of it the
last surviving farm land gave the tenement children a
playground, and the young couples of the neighborhood
a place to stroll in. The usual well kept and restrained
air of a small city park is very noticeable here. There
is almost no grass, the swings and running tracks are,
perhaps necessarily, caged by tall iron fences, and uninteresting
asphalt paths cover a considerable part of the
limited area. A large stone pergola, though of course
it has obvious uses, somehow deepens the impression
that an opportunity was lost in the laying out of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
place. At one side of the pergola, however, lie the
plots of the school farm in which small groups of
boys and girls may often be seen at work. Little attempt
has been made to develop a play center in the
park. On a fine Saturday afternoon it is often practically
empty.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Eleventh (“Death”) Avenue</span>]</p></div>

<p>Twelfth Avenue adjoins the Hudson River, losing
itself here and there in wharves and pier-heads.
Two of the piers belong to the city, one
being devoted to the disposal of garbage, the other
to recreation. Factories and an occasional saloon are
on the inland side, but there are almost no shacks or
tenements.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At first sight there are no striking features about the
Middle West Side. Hand-to-mouth existence reduces
living to a universal sameness which has little time or
place for variety. In street after street are the same
crowded and unsanitary tenements; the same untended
groups of playing children; the same rough men gathered
round the stores and saloons on the avenue; the
same sluggish women grouped on the steps of the tenements
in the cross streets. The visitor will find no
rambling shacks, no conventional criminal’s alleys;
only square, dull, monotonous ugliness, much dirt, and
a great deal of apathy.</p>

<p>The very lack of salient features is the supreme characteristic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of this neighborhood. The most noticeable
fact about it is that there is nothing to notice. It is
earmarked by negativeness. There is usually a lifelessness
about the streets and buildings, even at their
best, which is reflected in the attitude of the people
who live in them. The whole scene is dull, drab, uninteresting,
totally devoid of the color and picturesqueness
which give to so many poor districts a character
and fascination of their own. Tenth Avenue and the
streets west of it are lacking in the crowds and bustle
and brilliant lights of the East Side. Eleventh Avenue
by night is almost dark, and throughout the district
are long stretches of poorly lit cross streets in which only
the dingy store windows shine feebly. Over the East
River great bridges throw necklaces of light across
the water; here the North River is dark and unspanned.</p>

<p>What is it that has brought about this condition?
Why is this part of New York so utterly featureless and
depressing? The answer lies primarily not with the
present or past inhabitants, but in the isolation and
neglect to which for years it has been subjected. Much
of the Middle West Side was once naturally attractive,
with prosperous homesteads and cottages with gardens.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
But while other parts of Manhattan were being
developed as a city, the Middle West Side was left
severely alone. It was one of the last sections of the
city to become thickly populated. When the first factories
arrived, they brought the tenements in their
wake. The worst kinds of tenements were hastily
built&mdash;anything was supposed to be good enough for
the poor Irish who settled there; and these tenements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
have long survived in spite of their dilapidated condition
because until recently there has been no one who
cared for the rough and dull West Sider. East Side
problems were much more picturesque and inviting.
So our district has grown up under a heritage of desolation
and neglect, uninteresting to look at, unpleasant
to live in, overlooked, unsympathized with, and neglected
into aloofness, till today its static population
is almost isolated from and little affected by the life of
the rest of the city. The casual little horse car which
jingles up Tenth Avenue four times an hour is typical
of the West Sider’s home, just as the Draft Riots of
1863 were typical of his temper.</p>

<p>The nationalities which largely form the basis of the
population on the Middle West Side are the German
and the Irish, the latter predominating.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Peculiar to
the district is the large number of families of the second
generation with parents who have been born and
brought up in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>The nationality of the American-born parents throws
additional light on the subject of racial make-up of
the population.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> There were 81 American-born fathers
and 92 American-born mothers in the 241 families.
The parentage of 67 American-born fathers for whom
information was available was as follows: 28, German;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
21, Irish; 15, American; and 3, English. The parentage
of 73 American-born mothers was: 28, German;
25, Irish; 18, American; and 2, English. The country
of birth of parents of 14 of the American-born fathers
and 19 of the American-born mothers could not be
ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>We are accustomed to regard the German as the best
of European emigrants. He brings with him a thrift
and solidity which have taught us to depend on him.
He has been a welcome immigrant as he has become a
successful citizen. Yet here are large numbers of Germans
living in a wild no-man’s-land which has a criminal
record scarcely surpassed by any other district in
New York. Surely this is more than a case of the
exception proving the rule. It shows that our estimate
of the Middle West Side is correct.</p>

<p>The district is like a spider’s web. Of those who
come to it very few, either by their own efforts, or
through outside agency, ever leave it. Now and then
a boy is taken to the country or a family moves to the
Bronx, but this happens comparatively seldom. Usually
those who come to live here find at first (like
Yorick’s starling) that they cannot get out, and presently
that they do not want to. It is not that conditions
throughout the district are economically extreme,
although greater misery and worse poverty cannot be
found in other parts of New York. But there is something
in the dullness of these West Side streets and the
traditional apathy of their tenants that crushes the
wish for anything better and kills the hope of change.
It is as though decades of lawlessness and neglect have
formed an atmospheric monster, beyond the power and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
understanding of its creators, overwhelming German
and Irish alike.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the background of the West Side
boy. It is a gray picture, so gray that the casual visitor
to these streets may think it over-painted. But
this is because a superficial glance at the Middle West
Side is peculiarly misleading. So much lies below the
surface. It is obvious that this district has come to
be singularly unattractive, and that its methods of life
are extraordinarily rough. And it is equally true that
hundreds of boys never know any other place or life
than this, and that most of their offenses against the
law are the direct result of their surroundings. The
charges brought against them in court are only in part
against the boys themselves. The indictment is in the
main against the city which considers itself the greatest
and most progressive in the New World, for allowing
any of its children to start the battle of life so poorly
equipped and so handicapped for becoming efficient
American citizens. Not that these youngsters have
not their share of “devilment” and original sin, but in
estimating the work of the juvenile court with the boys
of this neighborhood, it is absolutely essential to bear
in mind not only the crimes they commit, but their
chances for escaping criminality. If heredity and environment
have any meaning, Tenth Avenue has much
to answer for.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="large">HIS PLAYGROUND</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> boy himself is blissfully untroubled by any
serious thoughts about his background; and
to him these streets are as a matter of course
a place to play in. This point of view is perfectly
natural for several reasons:</p>

<p>In the first place, he has never known any other
playground. At the earliest possible stage of infancy
he is turned out, perhaps under an older sister’s
supervision, to crawl over the steps of the tenement
or tumble about in the gutter in front of it, watching
with large eyes the new sights around him. Here he
is put to play, and here he learns to imitate the street
and sidewalk games of other boys and girls. He is
scarcely to be blamed for a point of view so universally
held that it never occurs to him to doubt it.</p>

<p>In the second place, the street is the place that he
must play in, whether he wants to or not. There is
no room for him in the house; the janitor usually
chases him off the roof. Excepting De Witt Clinton
Park, which, as has been shown, is small, restricted,
and inadequate, there is no park on the West Side
between Seventy-second and Twenty-eighth Streets.
Central Park and New Jersey are too inaccessible to be
his regular playgrounds. And besides, not only will
a boy not go far afield for his games, but he cannot.
He is often needed at home after school hours to run
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
errands and make himself generally useful. Moreover,
to go any distance involves a question of food and
transportation; so that except at times of truancy and
wanderlust, or when he is away on some baseball or
other expedition, the street inevitably claims him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_035a" src="images/i_035a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bounce Ball with Wall as Base</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bounce Ball with Steps as Base</span></p>

<p class="caption">Windows in danger</p></div>

<p>And in the third place, just because this playground
is so natural and so inevitable, he becomes attached
to it. It is the earliest, latest, and greatest influence
in his life. Long before he knew his alphabet it began
to educate him, and before he could toddle it was his
nursery. Every possible minute from babyhood to
early manhood is spent in it. Every day, winter and
summer, he is here off and on from early morning till
10 o’clock at night. It gives him a training in which
school is merely a repressive interlude. From the
quiet of the class room he hears its voice, and when
lessons are over it shouts a welcome at the door. The
attractions that it offers ever vary. Now a funeral,
now a fire; “craps” on the sidewalk; a stolen ride on
one of Death Avenue’s freight trains; a raid on a fruit
stall; a fight, an accident, a game of “cat”&mdash;always
fresh incident and excitement, always nerve-racking
kaleidoscopic confusion.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that the streets are regarded by
the boy as his rightful playground. They are the most
constant and vivid part of his life. They provide companionship,
invite to recklessness, and offer concealment.
Every year their attraction grows stronger, till
their lure becomes irresistible and his life is swallowed
up in theirs.</p>

<p>But unfortunately for the boy everyone does not
agree with him as to his right of possession. The
storekeeper, for instance, insists on the incompatibility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of a vigorous street ball game with the safety of his
plate glass windows. Drivers not unreasonably maintain
that the road is for traffic rather than for marbles
or stone throwing. Property owner, pedestrian, the
hardworking citizen, each has a point of view which
does not altogether favor the playground theory. At
the very outset of his career, therefore, in attempting
to exercise childhood’s inalienable right to play, the
boy finds himself colliding with the rights of property;
the maintenance of public safety, the enforcement of
law and order, and other things equally puzzling and
annoying, all apparently united in being inimical to
his ideas of amusement. He is too young to understand
that in his city’s scheme children were forgotten.
No one can explain to him that he has been born in a
congested area where lack of play space must be accepted
patiently; that life is a process of give and
take in which the rights of others demand as much
respect as his own. He does not know that his dilemma
is the problem which eternally confronts the city child.
But he does know that he must play. He has a store
of nervous energy and animal spirits which simply must
be let loose. Yet when he tries to play under the only
conditions possible to him he is hampered and repressed
at every turn. Inevitably he revolts; and long before
he is old enough to learn why most of his street games
are illegal, fun and law-breaking have become to him
inseparable, and the policeman his natural enemy.</p>

<p>So far the boy’s attitude is normal. Childish antagonism
to arbitrary authority is natural. In any large
town it extends to the police. All over New York
games are played with one eye on the corner and often
with a small scout or two on the watch for the “cop.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
But at this point two facts differentiate the Middle
West Side from the rest of the city, and make its situation
peculiar. On the one hand, the parents and older
people of the district, instead of showing the usual indifference
or at most a passive antipathy toward the
police, openly conspire against and are actively hostile
to them. On the other, the police, largely because of
this neighborhood feeling, are utterly unable to cope
with the lawless conditions which they find around
them.</p>

<p>This state of things has been brought about in various
ways. The lurid record of criminals in the district
has for years necessitated methods of policing which
have not made the Irish temper any less excitable.
Public sentiment here is almost static, and hatred of
the police has become a tradition. No one has a good
word for them; everyone’s hand is against them. The
boys look on them as spoil-sports and laugh at their
authority. The toughs and gangsters are at odds with
them perforce. Fathers and mothers, resenting the
trivial arrests of their children, consign the “cop,”
the “dinny” (detective), and “the Gerrys” to outer
darkness together. The better class of residents and
property owners, though their own failure to properly
support them is partly to blame for the failure of the
police to do their duty, frankly distrust them for being
so completely incompetent and ineffective. And now
perhaps no one would dare to support them. For the
toughs of the district have taken the law into their
own hands, and with the relentlessness and certainty
of a Corsican vendetta every injury received by them
is repaid, sooner or later, by some act of pitiless retaliation.
Honest or dishonest, successful or otherwise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the policeman certainly has a hard time of it. Wherever
he goes he is dangerously unpopular. He cannot
be safely active or inactive, and whatever he does
seems to add to his difficulties. Hectored on duty,
frequently bullied in court, misunderstood and abused
by press and public alike, he stands out solitary, the
butt and buffer of the neighborhood’s disorder.</p>

<p>It is scarcely remarkable that under these circumstances
the guardian of the law is bewildered, and
tends to become unreasonably touchy and suspicious.
“I tried to start a club in a saloon on Fiftieth Street
a while ago,” said a young Irishman of twenty-five.
“After we had had the club running one night, a policeman
came in and asked me for my license. I told him
I didn’t have any. He said he would have to break
up the club then. I kicked about this and he pinched
me. They brought me up for trial next morning, and
the judge told me I would have to close up my club.
I asked him why, and said the club was perfectly
orderly and was just made up of young fellows in the
neighborhood; and he said, ‘Well, your club has a
bad reputation, and you’ve got to break it up.’ Now,
how could a club have a bad reputation when it had
only been running one day? Tell me that? But that’s
the way of it. Those cops will give you a bad reputation
in five minutes if you never had one before in
your life.” “The cops are always arresting us and
letting us go again,” said a small West Sider. “I’ve
been taken up two or three times for throwing stones
and playing ball, but they never took me to the station
house yet. You can’t play baseball anywhere around
here without the cops getting you.” And so it has
come about that relations between police and people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in this section of New York are abnormally strained.
Provocation is followed by reaction, and reaction by
reprisal and a constant aggravation of annoyances, till
the tension continually reaches breaking point.</p>

<p>This situation shows very definite results in the boy.
Gradually his play becomes more and more mischievous
as he finds it easier to evade capture. Boylike, his
delight in wanton and malicious destruction is increased
by the knowledge that he will probably escape
punishment. Six-year-old Dennis opens the door of
the Children’s Aid Society school and throws a large
stone into the hall full of children. Another youngster
of about the same age recently was seen trying for
several minutes to break one of the street lamps. He
threw stone after stone until finally the huge globe fell
with a crash that could have been heard a block. Then
he ran off down the street and disappeared around the
corner. No one attempted to stop him; no one would
tell who he was. Later on, the boy begins to admire
and model himself on the perpetrators of picturesque
crimes whom he sees walking unarrested in the streets
around him. And by the time that he reaches the
gang age he is usually a hardened little ruffian whom
the safety of numbers encourages to carry his play to
intolerable lengths. He robs, steals, gets drunk, carries
firearms, and his propensity for fighting with stones
and bottles is so marked that for days whole streets
have been terrorized by his feuds. Insurance companies
either ask prohibitive rates for window glass in
this neighborhood or flatly refuse to insure it at all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the police are not idle. Public opinion
and their own records at the station house demand a
certain amount of activity, and every week the playground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
sees its arrests. In the following table we
have classified by causes, from our own intimate knowledge
of each individual case, the arrests which took
place during 1909 among the boys of our 241 families.
The court’s legal system of classification has been discarded
here in favor of the classification made to
show the real nature of each offense. The result
illustrates how entirely police intervention has failed
to meet the issue in the district, and consequently
explains in part why the work of the children’s court
with boys from this neighborhood has not proved more
effectual.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_bosr" href="#FNanchor_bosr" class="label">a</a>
For the classification of these arrests according to the court
charges see Chapter VI, The Boy and the Court, p. 82.</p></div>

<p>Not only is this table extraordinarily interesting in
itself, but its importance to our investigation is inestimable,
because it brings out certain features of the
problem with a vividness which could not be equaled
in pages of discussion or narrative.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it is noticeable how large a proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the arrests are for offenses which are more or
less excusable in these boys. Almost every one of their
offenses is due to one of four causes: neglect on the
part of the parent, the pressure of poverty, the expression
of pure boyish spirits, or the attempt to play.
Thievery, for instance, particularly the stealing of coal
from the docks or railroad tracks, is quite often encouraged
at home. “Johnnie is a good boy,” said one
mother quite frankly. “He keeps the coal and wood
box full nearly all the time. I don’t have to buy
none.” And her attitude is typical. Shouting and
singing too, and even loitering, do not seem on the
face of them overwhelmingly wicked. Of course, boys
sometimes choose the most impossible times and places
in which to shout and sing, but is no allowance to be
made for “the spirit of youth”? And as for the arrests
for play, they speak for themselves. Some of these
games, played when and where they are played, are
unquestionably dangerous to passersby and property,
while others are simply forms of gambling. But it
must be remembered that the West Side boy has nowhere
else to play; that his games are the games which
he sees around him, and he plays them because no one
has taught him anything better. The policeman, however,
has no interest in the responsibility of the boys
for their offenses; he is concerned merely with offenses
as such, and his arrests must be determined chiefly by
opportunity and by rule. All that we can ask of him
is to be tolerant, broad-minded, and sympathetic&mdash;a
request with which he will find it difficult enough to
comply if only because of the atmosphere of hostility
against him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is remarkable how seldom the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
boys are caught for very serious offenses.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Most of
the arrests shown here are for causes which are comparatively
trifling. Yet the whole neighborhood seethes
with the worst kinds of criminality, and many of the
boys are almost incredibly vicious. Stabbing, assault,
the use of firearms, acts of immorality, do not appear
in this table to an extent remotely approximating the
frequency with which they occur. In other words, the
police absolutely fail to cover the ground. Although
a large proportion of arrests does take place, they are
mostly on less important charges, and often involve
any one but the young criminal whose capture is really
desirable. The little sister of one boy who was “taken”
expressed the position exactly when she said, “The only
time Jimmy was caught was when he wasn’t doin’ anything
bad.”</p>

<p>In this way it happens that the fact of a boy’s arrest
is no clue to his character. Again and again boys “get
away with” their worst crimes, secretly committed, in
which they are protected from discovery by the neighborhood’s
code of ethics; whereas for minor offenses,
of which they are openly guilty, they are far more likely
to be arrested. Some of the worst offenders may never
be caught at all. And if one of them is taken, it is
probably for some technical misdemeanor which the
officer has used less for its own importance than as a
pretext for getting the boy into court. What is the
result? The policeman is lectured by the judge for
being an oppressor of the poor, and the boy is discharged,
though his previous record would entitle him
to a severe sentence, as both boy and policeman know.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally, respect for the court is soon lost,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and an arrest quickly comes to be treated with indifference,
or is looked upon merely as a piece of bad luck,
like a licking or a broken window. One boy recounted
recently with amusement how he moved the judge to
let him off: “I put on a solemn face and says, ‘Judge,
I didn’t mean to do it; I’ll promise not to do it again,’
and a lot of stuff like that, and the judge gives me a
talkin’ to and lets me go.” “Gee, that court was
easy!” was the comment of another. “You can get
away with anything down there except murder.” Experiences
in the juvenile court are invariably related
with a boyish contempt for the judges, who are looked
upon either as “easy guys to work” or as “a lot of
crooks” who “get theirs” out of their jobs. And so
the boy comes back to the streets, and plays there
more selfishly and more recklessly than ever.</p>

<p>His activities are not confined to the block in which
he lives or even to the streets of his neighborhood.
Any kind of space, from a roof or an area to a cellar
or an empty basement, is utilized as an addition to the
playground. But two places attract him particularly.
All the year around at some time of day or night you
can find him on the docks. In summer they provide
a ball ground, in winter, coal for his family, and always
a hiding place from the truant officer or the police.
Here along the river front he bathes in the hot weather,
encouraged by the city’s floating bath which anchors
close by, and regardless of the fact that the water is
filthy with refuse and sewage. In the stifling evenings,
too, when the band plays on the recreation pier and
there are lights and crowds and “somethin’ goin’ on,”
he is again drawn toward the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_047a" src="images/i_047a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wading in Sewage Laden Water</span></p></div>

<img id="i_047b" src="images/i_047b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A “Den” Under the Dock</span></p></div>

<p>And next to the streets and docks he loves the hallways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
There is something about those dark, narrow
passages which makes them seem built for gangs to
meet or play or plot in. The youth of the district and
his girl find other uses for them, but the boy and his
playmates have marked them for their games. Neighbors
who have no other place to “hang around in”
may protest, but the boys play on. They dirty the
floors, disturb the tenements by their noises, run into
people, and if they are lying here in wait are apt to chip
away the wainscoting or tear the burlap off the walls.
But what do they care! It’s all in the day’s play; and
if the janitor objects, so much the better, for he can
often be included in a game of chase.</p>

<p>Streets, roofs, docks, hallways,&mdash;these, then, are the
West Side boy’s playground, and will be for many
years to come. And what a playground it is! Day
and night, workdays and holidays alike, the streets are
never quiet, from the half-hour before the factory
whistles blow in the early morning, when throngs of
men and boys are hurrying off to work, to still earlier
morning hours when they echo with the footsteps of
the reveler returning home. All day long an endless
procession of wagons, drays, and trucks, with an occasional
automobile, jolts and clatters up and down the
avenue. Now and then an ambulance or undertaker’s
cart arrives, drawing its group of curious youngsters
to watch the casket or stretcher carried out. Drunken
men are omnipresent, and drunken women are seen.
Street fights are frequent, especially in the evening,
and, except for police annoyance or when “guns” come
into play, are generally regarded as diversions. Every
crime, every villainy, every form of sexual indulgence
and perversion is practiced in the district and talked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
of openly. The sacredness of life itself finds no protecting
influence in these blocks. There is no rest, no
order, no privacy, no spaciousness, no simplicity;
almost nothing that youth, the city’s everlasting hope,
should have, almost everything that it should not.</p>

<p>A family from another state moved recently into one
of these tenements. The only child, a boy of fifteen,
after several tentative efforts to reconcile himself to
street life, came in and announced his intention of
staying in the flat in leisure time thereafter, as he was
shocked and his finer feelings were hurt by what he
saw of the street life around him. His mother tried
to persuade him to go out, but the boy told her she
had no idea what she was doing, and refused to go.
He attempted to take his airings on the roof, but was
ordered down by the janitor. Finally he yielded to
his mother’s persuasion and went back to the street.
Within three months this boy, a type of the bright,
clean boyhood of our smaller towns, had become marked
by dissipation and had once even come home intoxicated.</p>

<p>What chance has the best of boys who must spend
two-thirds of his school days in such a playground?
What wonder that he becomes a callous young criminal,
when the very conditions of his play lead him to
crime? The whole influence of such conditions on a
child’s life can never be gauged. But just as apart
from his traditions and background he is incomprehensible
as a boy, so, as a wanton little ruffian, he is
unintelligible apart from his playground. This develops
his play into mischief and his mischief into crime. It
educates him superficially in the worst sides of life, and
makes him cynical, hard, and precocious. It takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
from him everything that is good; almost everything
that it gives him is bad. Its teachings and tendencies
are not civic but anti-social, and the boy reflects them
more and more. Every year he adds to a history of
lawless achievement which the court, police, and institutions
alike have proved powerless to prevent. And
every day the Middle West Side bears witness to the
truth of the saying that “a boy without a playground
is the father of the man without a job.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="large">HIS GAMES</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> would be impossible to describe the thousand and
one uses to which the West Side boy puts his playground.
After all, the street is not such a bad
place to play in if you have known nothing better;
and as you tumble out of school on a fine afternoon,
ready for mischief, it offers you almost anything, from
a fight with your best friend to a ride on the steps
of an ice wagon. But certain games and sports are so
universal in this district as to deserve separate mention.</p>

<p>Spring is the season for marbles. On any clear day
in March or February you may find the same scene on
roadway and sidewalks of every block&mdash;a huddle of
multicolored marbles in the middle of a ring, and a
group of excited youngsters, shrieking, quarreling, and
tumbling all over each other, just outside the circle.
Instead of the time-honored chalk ring the boys often
use the covers of a manhole, whose corrugated iron
surface offers obstacles and therefore gives opportunity
for unusual skill. Another game consists in
shooting marbles to a straight line drawn along the
middle of the sidewalk; thus one such game may be
continued through the whole length of the block. In
another the marbles are pitched against a brick wall
or against the curbstone, and the boy whose marbles
stop closest to a chalked mark wins the marbles of all
competitors.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>As the fall days grow shorter and the afternoons
more crisp, bonfires become the rage. The small boy
has an aptitude for finding wood at need in places
where one would suppose that no fuel of any kind
would be obtainable. A careless grocer leaves a barrel
of waste upon the sidewalk. In five minutes’ time
that barrel may be burning in the middle of the street
with a group of cheering youngsters warming their
hands at the blaze, or watching it from their seats on
the curbstone. The grocer may berate the boys and
threaten disaster to the one who lit the barrel, but he
is seldom able to find the culprit. Before the barrel
is completely burned some youngster produces a stick
or two which he has found in an areaway or pulled
from a passing wagon, and adds it to the fire. Stray
newspapers, bits of excelsior, rags, and even garbage
are contributed to keep the fire going, regardless of the
effect on the olfactory nerves of the neighborhood.
The police extinguish these fires whenever they can,
but the small boy meets this contingency by posting
scouts, and on the alarm of “Cheese it!” the fire is
stamped out and the embers are hastily concealed.
The “cop” sniffs at the smoke and looks at the boys
suspiciously, but suspicions do not bother the boys&mdash;they
are used to them&mdash;and when he has passed on
down the street the fragments of the fire are reassembled
and lighted again. On a cold evening one may
see half a dozen of these bonfires flaming in different
directions, each with a group of small figures playing
around them. Sticks are thrust into the fire and waved
in figures in the air; and among them very often circle
larger and brighter spots of light which glow into a full
flame when the motion ceases. These are fire pots, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
ingenious invention consisting of an empty tomato can
with a wire loop attached to the top by which to swing
it, and filled with burning wood. This amusement
might seem harmless enough if it were not for the fact
that these fire pots, being of small boy construction,
have an unfortunate habit of slipping from the wire
loop just as they are being most rapidly hurled.</p>

<p>On election night, until recently, the boys’ traditional
right of making bonfires has been observed. These bonfires
are sometimes elaborate. As early as the middle
of October the youngsters begin hoarding wood for the
great occasion. They pile the fuel in the rear of a tenement
or in the areaway or basement of some friendly
grocer, or perhaps in a vacant lot or at the rear of a
factory. Frequently to save their plunder they find it
necessary to post guards for the few days preceding
election, and even so, bonfire material often becomes
the center of a furious gang fight. A few of the stronger
gangs have a settled policy of letting some other gang
collect their fuel for them, and then raiding them at the
last minute. The victors carry the wood back triumphantly
to their own block, and the vanquished are
left either to collect afresh or to make reprisal on a still
weaker gang. This kind of warfare continues even
while the fires are burning on election night. A gang
will swoop down unawares on a rival bonfire, scatter
the burning material, and retire with the unburnt
pieces to their own block.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> A recent election time,
however, proved a gloomy one for the little West
Siders. Wagons appeared in the streets, filled with fire
hose and manned by firemen and police. The police
scattered the boys while the firemen drenched the fires,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
and by 8 o’clock the streets, formerly so picturesque
and so dangerous, presented a sad and sober appearance.
The tenement lights shone out on heaps of
blackened embers and on groups of despairing youngsters
who were not even permitted to stand on the
corners and contemplate the destruction of their
evening’s festivities.</p>

<p>In the winter the shortcomings of the street as a
playground are especially evident. Frost and sleet
and a bitter wind give few compensations for the discomfort
which they bring. Traffic, the street cleaning
department, and the vagaries of the New York climate,
make most ways of playing in the snow impossible.
But snowballing continues, in spite of the efforts of the
police to prevent it. It is open to the same objections
as baseball in the street, for the freedom which is possible
in the small towns or in the country cannot be
tolerated in a crowded district where a snowball which
misses one mark is almost certain to hit another.
Moreover, owing to the facility with which these boys
take to dangerous forms of sport, the practice of making
snowballs with a stone or a piece of coal in the
middle and soaking them in ice water is even more
prevalent here than in most other localities. Of course,
snowballing is forbidden and abhorred by the neighborhood,
and everyone takes a hand in chastising the
juvenile snowball thrower. Nevertheless, the afternoon
of the first fall is sure to bring a snow fight, and the
innocent passerby is likely to be involuntarily included
in the game.</p>

<p>Marbles and bonfires and snowballs are the sports
of the smaller boys exclusively, but other games which
are less seasonal are played by old and young alike.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
“Shooting craps,” for instance, and pitching or matching
pennies, are occupations which endure all the year
round and are participated in by grown men as well as
by boys. On a Sunday morning dozens of crap games
are usually in full swing along the streets. Only two
players handle the dice, but almost any number of bystanders
can take part by betting amongst themselves
on the throw&mdash;“fading,” as it is called. Pennies, dimes,
or dollar bills, according to the prosperity of the bettor,
will be thrown upon the sidewalk, for craps is one of
the cheapest and most vicious forms of gambling, since
there is absolutely no restriction in the betting. Perfect
strangers may join in at will if the players will let
them, and there are innumerable opportunities for
playing with crooked dice. It is one of the chief forms
of sidewalk amusements in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>Up above the sidewalks, on the roofs of the tenements,
there is some flying of small kites, but pigeon
flying is the chief sport. It provides an occupation
less immediately remunerative, perhaps, than games of
chance, but developed by the same unmoral tendencies
which seem to turn all play in the district into vice.
Some boys, through methods of accretion peculiar to
this neighborhood, have a score or more of pigeons
which are kept in the house, and taken up to the roof
regularly every Sunday, and oftener during the summer,
for exercise. The birds are tamed and carefully
taught to return to their home roofs after flight, but
ingenious boys have discovered many ways of luring
them to alien roofs, so that now the sport of pigeon
flying is as dangerously exciting as a commercial venture
in the days of the pirates. Pigeon owners also
train their birds to circle about the neighborhood and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
bring back strangers. These strangers are taken inside,
fed, and accustomed to the place before they are
released again. On Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings
the pigeons are to be seen flying around the neighborhood,
while behind the chimneys of every fourth or
fifth tenement house are crouched one or two small
boys armed with long sticks, occasionally giving a low
peculiar whistle to attract the pigeons coming from distant
roofs. The sticks have a triple use. Pigeon owners
use them to force their pigeons to fly for exercise;
the little pigeon thieves on the roofs have a net on the
end of their sticks for catching the bird when it alights;
and most pigeons are trained to remain passive at the
touch of the stick so that they may be picked up easily
by their owner. This training, of course, operates to
the advantage of the thief as well as of the owner, and
valuable birds are sometimes lured away and held for
ransom.</p>

<p>The two chief sports of the Middle West Side&mdash;baseball
and boxing&mdash;are perennial. The former, played
as it always is, with utter carelessness and disregard
of surroundings, is theoretically intolerable, but it
flourishes despite constant complaints and interference.
The diamond is marked out on the roadway,
the bases indicated by paving bricks, sticks, or newspapers.
Frequently guards are placed at each end of
the block to warn of the approach of police. One
minute a game is in full swing; the next, a scout cries
“Cheese it!” Balls, bats, and gloves disappear with
an alacrity due to a generation of practice, and when
the “cop” appears round the corner the boys will be
innocently strolling down the streets. Notwithstanding
these precautions, as the juvenile court records
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
show, they are constantly being caught. In a great
majority of these match games too much police vigilance
cannot be exercised, for a game between a dozen
or more boys, of from fourteen to eighteen years of age,
with a league ball, in a crowded street, with plate glass
windows on either side, becomes a joke to no one but
the participants. A foul ball stands innumerable
chances of going through the third-story window of a
tenement, or of making a bee line through the valuable
plate glass window of a store on the street level, or of
hitting one of the passersby. And if the hit is a fair
one, it is as likely as not to land on the forehead of a
restive horse, or to strike some little child on the sidewalk
farther down the street. When one sees the
words “Arrested for playing with a hard ball in a public
street” written on a coldly impersonal record card
in the children’s court one is apt to become indignant.
But when you see the same hard ball being batted
through a window or into a group of little children on
this same public street, the matter assumes an entirely
different aspect.</p>

<p>Clearly, from the community’s point of view, the
playing of baseball in the street is rightly a penal
offense. It annoys citizens, injures persons and property,
and interferes with traffic. But for all that, it is
not abolished, and probably under present municipal
conditions never will be, simply because there is another
point of view, that of the boy, and his protest
against its suppression is almost equally unanswerable.
The store windows are filled with a tempting array of
baseball gloves and bats offered at prices as close as
possible to his means, and every effort is made by responsible
business men, who themselves know the law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and the need for order on the streets, to induce him
to buy them. Selling the boy those bats and balls is
a form of business and is perfectly legal. And the boy
cannot see why, after having paid his money for them,
the merchant should have all the benefit of the transaction.
The game is in itself perfectly harmless; and
childhood has an abiding resentment against apparently
inexplicable injustice. Perhaps the small boy believes
that except for the odds against him his right to make
use of the street in his own way is as assured as that
of anyone else. Perhaps he reflects that he too has to
make sacrifices; that a broken window means usually
a lost ball, and a damaged citizen, a ruined game. At
any rate he continues to play, and as things are, has
a fairly good case for doing so.</p>

<p>This neighborhood is also full of regularly organized
ball teams, ranging in the age of players from ten to
thirty years. Many of the large factories have teams
made up of their own employes. Almost every street
gang has its own team, as has almost every social club.
These teams meet in regularly matched games, on the
waterfront, in the various city parks, or over in New
Jersey. Practically all the teams, old and young alike,
play for stakes, ranging from two to five dollars a side.
When they do not, they call it simply a “friendly”
game. There is no organization among them; one
team challenges another, and the two will decide on
some place to play the game. A few of the adult teams
lease Sunday grounds in New Jersey, but most of them
trust to the chance of finding one. The baseball leaders
of the neighborhood usually have uniforms, and to
belong to a uniformed team is one of the great ambitions
of the West Side boy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>Down on the waterfront the broad, smooth quays
offer a tempting place for baseball, especially on Sundays
and summer evenings, when they are generally
bare of freight. But it has one serious drawback, that
a foul ball on one side invariably goes into the river,
and the players must have either several balls or a
willing swimmer if the game is to continue long. One
Sunday game, for instance, between two fourteen-year-old
teams, played near the water, cost five balls,
varying in price from 50 cents to $1.00 each. The
game was played before a scrap-iron yard, the high
fence of which was used as a backstop. Fifty feet to
the right was the Hudson River. Within a hundred
feet of second base, in the center field, a slip reached
from the line of the river to the street, which was just
beyond third base on the other side. Behind the sixteen-foot
fence of the scrap-iron yard were a savage dog
at large and a morose watchman to keep out river
thieves. Thus hemmed in by water on two sides, a
street car line and a row of glass windows on the third
side, and a high fence, a savage dog, and a watchman
on the fourth, the boys started the game. In the first
inning a new dollar ball was fouled over the fence into
the scrap-iron yard and the watchman refused to let
the boys in to hunt for it. The game was stopped
while a deputation of boys from both sides walked up
to a nearby street to buy a new fifty-cent ball. The
first boy up when the game was resumed batted this
ball into the Hudson River, where a youthful swimmer
got it, and climbing ashore down the river, made away
with it. A third ball was secured, and before the game
was half over this ball was batted into the river, where
it lodged underneath a barge full of paving stones which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
was made fast to the dock, and could not be recovered.
Then a fourth ball was produced. This lasted till the
game was almost finished, though it was once batted
deep into center field, where it bounced into the slip
and stopped the game while it was being fished out.
Finally it followed the first ball into the scrap-iron yard,
and neither taunts nor pleas could move the obdurate
watchman to let the boys in to find it. The game was
finished with a fifth ball which was the personal property
of one of the boys. On the occasion of another
game in this same place two balls were batted into the
scrap-iron yard and lost while the teams were warming
up before the match began. A third ball was batted
into the river twice but both times it was recovered.
Baseball is played on the docks unmodified, but in the
streets the boys make use of various adaptations, some
of which dispense with the bat and in consequence
lessen the dangers of the game.</p>

<p>Ball playing continues sporadically all the year
round, and never loses popularity, but it is, of course,
mainly a game for the summer. During the winter
among the small boys, youths, and men alike, boxing
is the all-absorbing sport. It is hard for an outsider
to understand the tremendous hold which prize fighting
has upon the boys in a neighborhood of this kind.
Fights are of course of common occurrence, not only
among children but among grown men. This in itself
gives a great impetus to the study of the art of self-defense.
Good fighters become known early in this district.
Professional prize fighters are everywhere; and
for every boy who has actually succeeded in getting
into the prize ring on one or more occasions, there are
a dozen who are eager and anxious for an opportunity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
The various athletic clubs of the city always offer
chances to boys from fourteen to sixteen years old to
appear in the “preliminaries,” as the boxing contests
which precede the main bout of the evening are called.
A boy who gains a reputation as a street fighter and
boxer will be recommended to the manager of an athletic
club as a likely aspirant. He is given a chance
to box in one or two rounds with another would-be
prize fighter in a “preliminary.” If he makes a good
showing, he is paid from five to fifteen dollars according
to his ability and experience, and is given another
chance. If he can continue to make favorable appearances
in these preliminaries, he will soon be given a
chance of taking part in a six or eight-round bout at
one of the smaller athletic clubs, and from that time
on he takes regular status as a prize fighter, and accordingly
becomes a hero in his circle of youthful acquaintances.
There are many such small prize fighters in
our district, none of them over twenty-one years of
age, and all earning just enough to make it possible to
lead a life of indolence. If they can make ten or fifteen
dollars by appearing in a ring once a week, they are
quite content.</p>

<p>But boxing and street fighting by no means always
go together on the Middle West Side. The real professional
boxers of the neighborhood dissociate them
in practice as well as in theory; they take their profession
for what it is&mdash;a game to be played in a sportsmanlike
manner&mdash;and they are usually good-natured.
One of the best known prize fighters of the city, who
lives on the Middle West Side, states that it is years
since he was mixed up in a fight of any kind. “I box
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
because I like the game,” he said, “but I’ve no use for
fighting.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Craps with Money at Stake</span></p></div>

<p>Another man, an exceedingly clever lightweight
boxer, who has appeared several times in the ring in
New York City clubs, was boxing one night with a
rather crude amateur. The bout was really for the
instruction of the amateur, and both boxers were going
very easily by agreement. Suddenly the amateur
landed an unintentionally hard blow upon the eye of
his opponent, just as the latter was stepping forward.
The eye became fearfully discolored and the whole
side of the boxer’s face swelled. But in spite of his
evident feeling that the amateur had taken an unfair
advantage in striking so hard when his opponent was
off his guard, the lightweight fighter laughed and submitted
to treatment for the eye without losing his
temper in the least, and freely accepted the apologies
of the other.</p>

<p>This is boxing at its best, but unfortunately its
tendencies are more usually toward unfairness and
brutality than otherwise. Boys are taught to box
early in this district. It is not uncommon to see a
bout between youngsters of seven or eight being watched
by a crowd of young men, who encourage the combatants
by cheering every successful blow, but pay no
attention to palpable fouls or obvious attempts to take
a dishonest advantage. Even some of the best of the
prize fighters frankly say that once in the ring the
extent to which they foul is only a question of how
much they can deceive the referee. And when this
questionable code of ethics is passed on by these heroes
and leaders of sentiment to the boys who have no
referee and no thought beyond that of winning by disabling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
an opponent as much as possible, the sport degenerates
into an unfair and tricky test of endurance.
Striking with the open hand, kicking, tripping, hitting
in a clinch, all these unfair practices are considered a
great advantage if one can “get away with it.” The
West Side youngster sees very little of the real professional
boxers who, from the very nature of their somewhat
strenuous employment, must keep in good condition,
as a rule retire early, drink little, and do a great
deal of hard gymnastic work. But of their brutalized
hangers-on, the “bruisers,” who frequent the saloons
and street corners and pose as real fighters, he sees a
great deal; consequently, as a whole, prize fighting
must be classed as one of the worst influences of the
neighborhood. It is too closely allied with street fighting,
and too easily turned to criminal purposes. The
bully who learns to box will use his acquired knowledge
as a means of enforcing his superiority on the street,
and if he is beaten will have recourse to weapons or
any other means of maintaining his prestige.</p>

<p>Baseball and boxing bring to a close the list of common
outdoor games played by boys on the Middle West
Side,&mdash;just ordinary games, modified by a particular
environment and played in a shifting and spasmodic
way which is characteristic of it. It remains to emphasize
the lesson taught by their effects on boy life
as they are practiced in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the West Side youngster is practical
and not speculative. Otherwise he could not fail
to notice very early in his career that the world in general,
from the mother who bundles him out of an overcrowded
tenement in the morning, to the grown-ups in
the street playground where most of his time is spent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
seem to think him very much in the way. All day
long this fact is borne in upon him. If a wagon nearly
runs over him the driver lashes him with the whip as
he passes to teach him to “watch out.” If he plays
around a store door the proprietor gives him a cuff or
a kick to get rid of him. If he runs into someone he
is pushed into the gutter to teach him better. And if
he is complained of as a nuisance the policeman whacks
him with hand or club to notify him that he must play
somewhere else. Moreover, everything that he does
seems to be against the law. If he plays ball he is
endangering property by “playing with a hard ball in
a public place.” If he plays marbles or pitches pennies
he is “obstructing the sidewalk,” and craps, quite
apart from the fact that it is gambling, constitutes the
same offense. Street fighting individually or collectively
is “assault,” and a boy guilty of none of these
things may perforce be “loitering.” In other words he
finds that property or its representatives are the great
obstacles between him and his pleasure in the streets.
And in considering our problem neither the principal
cause of this situation nor its results must be lost
sight of.</p>

<p>The great drawback to normal life on the Middle
West Side is that it is a dual neighborhood. Tenements
and industrial establishments are so inextricably
mixed that the demands of the family and the needs
of industry and commerce are eternally in conflict.
The same streets must be used for all purposes; and
one of the chief sufferers is the boy. More obvious,
however, than this cause of a complex situation are the
results of it, two of which are especially noticeable.
The first is the inevitableness with which the boy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
accepts&mdash;and must accept&mdash;illegal and immoral amusements
as a matter of course. The spirit of youth is
forced to become a criminal tendency, and sport and
the rights of property are forced into antagonism.
And in the second place, partly because of this, partly
because their association with the toughs of the street
predisposes them to imitate vice and rowdyism, the
boys come to take a positive pleasure in such activities
as retaliation by theft and destruction of property.
Stores and basements in this district are sometimes
completely abandoned owing to the stone throwing
and persecution of a youthful gang which has found
their occupants too strenuously hostile or defensive.
Undoubtedly the street is the most inadequate of playgrounds
and throws many difficulties of prevention and
interruption in the path of sport. But these obstacles
are from their nature provocative of contest, and sport
flourishes with a Hydra-like vitality. Nothing short
of impossibility will keep the boy and his game apart.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="large">HIS GANGS</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is frequently necessary in these chapters to consider
the boy of the Middle West Side as a type;
and in discussing the causes and possible solution
of the conditions which have produced him it is easy
to forget that what the individual boy actually is at
the moment is also of very real importance. But as
a matter of fact it is not the boy individually but the
boy collectively that is the policeman’s bane and the
district’s despair. Once on the street the boy is no
longer an individual but a member of a gang; and it
is with and through the gang that he justly earns a
reputation which provoked an irate citizen recently to
suggest that for the New York street urchin boiling in
burning oil was too good a fate. The court finds him
a little villain, and newspapers tell the public that he
is a little desperado; but those who know him best
know that he is probably worse than either court or
public suppose, and that for this the development of
the gang on the West Side is primarily responsible.</p>

<p>The formation of “sets” or “gangs” is almost a law
of human nature, and boyhood one of its most constant
exponents, for a boy is gregarious naturally as
well as by training. And over here, where the sociable
Irish-American element predominates and children
rarely mention the word “home,” it is inevitable that
the gang should flourish and its members try to find in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
its activities the rough affection, comfort, and amusement
which a dirty and overcrowded tenement room
has failed to give.</p>

<p>The West Side gang is in its origin perfectly normal.
In the words of one of the boys, “De kids livin’ on de
street jist naturally played together, an’ stuck together
w’en anything came up about kids from any other
street.” Nothing is more entirely natural and spontaneous,
and it is exasperating to reflect that nothing
could be a more persuasive and uplifting power in the
boy’s life than the gang’s development when given
proper scope and direction. Its influence is strong and
immediate. The gang contains the friends to whose
praise and criticism he is most keenly sensitive, its standards
are his aims, and its activities his happiness. Untrammeled
by the perversion of special circumstances it
might encourage his latent interests, train him to obedience
and loyalty, show him the method and the saving
of co-operation, and teach him the beauty of self-sacrifice.
Gang life at its best does so. The universal
endorsement and success of the Boy Scout movement,
for instance, in almost every country living under
Western civilization, shows this most clearly. Association
and rivalry should bring out what is best in a boy;
but on the Middle West Side it almost invariably brings
out what is worst. Practically, under present conditions,
it is inevitable that this should be so; but with
the first movement toward amelioration such a result
becomes less necessary.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">After the Battle</span></p></div>

<p>Take the case of a certain gang typical of this neighborhood.
This gang is now several years old, but its
membership is almost exactly what it was four or five
years ago. Its members singled each other out from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the throng of children in their immediate neighborhood
and first made for themselves a cave between two lumber
piles in a neighboring yard. All one summer they
met in this “hang-out”; here they brought the “loot,”
as they call the product of their marauding expeditions,
threw craps, pitched pennies, played cards, smoked,
told stories, and fought. But they were disturbed by
early disaster in the shape of the business needs of the
lumber company, which one day caused their shack to
be torn down over their heads. They made their headquarters
next in the empty basement of a tenement, but
soon moved at the well reinforced request of the landlord.
After an exiled period of meeting on the street
corners, the boys conceived the idea of building their
own habitation in the protection of their own homes.
They began a small wooden structure in the areaway
of the tenement in which the leader lived. But civil
war broke out, and in one unhappy culmination the
leader of the gang chased his own little brother up two
flights of stairs with a hatchet. The little brother
promptly “squealed,” and the projected headquarters
was destroyed by parental decree.</p>

<p>There followed another interval of meeting on the
streets, and then one of the workers in a neighboring
settlement became interested. She arranged to have
the boys hold meetings in the settlement once a week.
They were given certain privileges in the gymnasium
and game rooms also, which kept them happily occupied
and away from the street influences. But the settlement
was closed suddenly and the gang went back
to the streets once more. Here is a case in which a
gang were from the outset driven from pillar to post
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
by the deficiencies of their surroundings as a playground,
and made to feel that every man’s hand was
against them. When kindness was shown to them they
responded at once. And scores of other gangs, if they
were given the chance, would respond in the same way.</p>

<p>There are two salient features of gang life in this
neighborhood. Both can be easily explained and abundantly
illustrated; the second alone applies equally to
schoolboy gangs and to adult gangs&mdash;for bands of adult
rowdies exist, too, and the semi-mythical “Gopher
Gang”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> is a terror to conjure with. The first of these
features is the loyalty which the gang invariably shows
to a single street or block. As a gang is naturally
formed of boys who live in the same tenement or next
door to each other, or at least in the same block, and
as their chief playground is likely to be the street in
front of that block, it naturally becomes a matter of
convenience as well as of honor to defend that playground
from the inroads of any other gang. In this
way loyalty to one block becomes a principle and a
basis of gang organization. But individuals are not
always loyal to their home block. If a boy becomes a
member of a gang on Fiftieth Street, for example, and
then moves to Thirtieth Street, or even farther, he
may return and continue to belong to his old gang.
Similarly, a Thirtieth Street gang will number among
its ranks former residents who now live in other localities.
At the same time, both gangs are continually
being recruited by new arrivals in the community.
When a boy moves he simply uses his own discretion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
as to whether to join the new gang or to continue to
belong to the old.</p>

<p>The gang is constantly increasing or decreasing its
numbers. It does not necessarily include the whole
street except in a very general sense. Its nucleus is to
be found in probably a dozen or fifteen kindred spirits
in the street. For purposes of war, or for demonstrations
at election time, or on any such occasion when
there is either safety or pleasure in numbers, the other
boys in the street are added to this group. Thus the
real Fiftieth Street gang may not number more than
20 or 25 members, but its fighting strength when pitted
against the Fifty-thirds will be nearly a hundred.
Again, while there may be one group of 15 or 20 boys
known as “The Fiftieth Street Gang,” yet on Fiftieth
Street between any two avenues will be found a dozen
or more similar groups, each with a leader and a
coherent social consciousness. The one among these
groups which will be called the Fiftieth Street gang is
likely to be so known either because it contains the boy
who, for one reason or another, has become the recognized
street leader, or because its members are better
known or more daring than any other group, so that
it will be around this particular group that all the others
will rally when the occasion calls. The territorial limit
of a gang is usually the length of one single cross street
between two avenues. In a single week fights took
place between the Fiftieth Street gang between Tenth
and Eleventh Avenues, and the Fifty-third Street gang
in the same district; between the Forty-ninth Street
gang between Ninth and Tenth Avenues combined
with the Forty-ninth Street gang between Tenth and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Eleventh Avenues, and the Forty-seventh Street gang
between Ninth and Tenth Avenues.</p>

<p>Loyalty to their home block would be a good habit
in boyish <i>camaraderie</i> if it merely took the form of
peaceable rivalry; but as gang life exists at present on
the Middle West Side it becomes a chronic incentive
to lawlessness. For the second salient feature of gang
life is the propensity of the gang to street fighting.
Personal and collective jealousies and feuds have become
so habitual and endless among the boys here that
the history of their gangs is little less than a record of
continuous violence of every kind. No doubt the
strain of the constant repression before alluded to in
some measure accounts for this; but possibly it is due
in general to a contact with the streets and in particular
to the bad influence of the older toughs on whom
they model themselves and who often attain heroic
position in their eyes. The boys of gangs in the country
play that they are armies, emperors, or kings that
they have read of in books or heard of in stories told.
But the city boys of the West Side prefer to imitate
local celebrities whom they know or local deeds of
fame with which they are more intimately acquainted.
And the danger of this vulgarized hero worship lies in
the fact that, while a country lad must imagine the
surroundings and implements for imitating the deeds
of story book heroes, the city boy can find on every
side of him the real materials used by his models, the
Gophers.</p>

<p>The jargon of the thief and the yeggman is common
among these boys’ gangs. They talk casually of murder
and robbery as though these were familiar events
in their lives. They lay tentative plans for the robbery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of stores or saloons with no more real intention
of commission than the schoolboy football player
has of actual achievement when he imagines what he
would do if his team were playing Yale. They talk
easily and knowingly of “turning off” various people
in the neighborhood, by which they mean robbing
them. They threaten each other with murder and
other dire forms of assault, and undoubtedly think
that they mean to carry out their threats. The first
active manifestation of this state of mind consists often
in carrying concealed weapons. The boy obtains a
broken revolver from some place or finds or steals a
good one. He will reveal this weapon to his awestruck
playmates and soon come to pose as a bold, ruffianly
spirit. Usually this phase passes away harmlessly
enough. Few of the younger residents of this neighborhood
are really armed, though most of them would
have their companions believe that they are. Occasionally
some youngster does manage to carry a revolver,
bowie knife, or slingshot, and his subsequent
career is likely to bring him very early into serious
contact with the police. But however late or soon the
manifestation, the gangs are permeated by the tendency
to disorder and crime which is the result of
criminal example. It is the old story; only the worst
and most vicious form of the gang spirit has a chance
of finding expression in these streets. And so gang
warfare has become not the exception but the rule, and
the violence and ferocity with which the small boys
pursue their feuds excites the alarm of the entire
neighborhood.</p>

<p>“There has always been more or less fighting among
the gangs of boys on the streets,” a physician of long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
residence recently remarked, “but they are getting
worse in character every year until now it seems that
they will stop at nothing. They carry knives, clubs,
and even, I have heard, revolvers. Sometimes arrests
are made, but they never amount to anything, for the
boys are always released without punishment. If an
outsider tries to interfere, ordinarily both gangs turn
on him. They terrorize the neighborhood with their
fights, breaking windows and injuring passersby with
stones. Only recently one of these fights broke out
almost in front of my house, and a score or more, most
of them armed with beer bottles, were engaged in it.
I got a boy by the shoulder and asked him what he was
doing with the bottle. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I am just taking
it to the store to get it filled.’ Then he laughed in my
face and the rest of the gang burst out laughing. I
could do nothing with them, and had to retire to my
office.”</p>

<p>Sometimes fights are more or less unpremeditated,
arising from chance encounters between two rival gangs;
but very often they are formally arranged and generaled
in approved military fashion. One evening recently a
furious battle took place between two gangs of small
boys numbering nearly 50 to the gang, and all apparently
from eight to fifteen years old. One gang proceeded
down the street from the corner at which they
had assembled and met the other gang coming from the
opposite direction. They stopped about 100 feet apart
and formed two compact masses, screaming and shouting
encouragement to their own side and insults to the
enemy. Then one of the gangs moved slowly forward.
Some one among their opponents threw a beer bottle
into the advancing crowd, and a scene of wild riot followed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Clubs, stones, and beer bottles were hurled
through the air, many of them taking effect and many
of the bottles smashing on the pavement. A crowd
gathered on both sides behind the combatants and
windows on all sides were filled with spectators. None
of the boys came into personal contact with their opponents.
Most of them contented themselves with
hurling missiles indiscriminately into the opposing
group. In the midst of the mêlée two boys were
maneuvering for over a minute, each armed with a
beer bottle which he was trying to land on his opponent
from a distance of not more than eight or ten feet.
They ducked, dodged, and side-stepped, then finally
one boy threw his bottle. The other boy dropped flat
to the pavement and the bottle came so close to his
body that it looked for an instant as though it had hit
him. If it had, it might easily have killed him, for it
was hurled with terrific force. But the boy sprang up
and threw his bottle at the other youngster, who was
now retreating.</p>

<p>Just as it was growing dark someone fired two shots
from a revolver&mdash;whether loaded with blank or bullet
cartridges it was of course impossible to tell&mdash;and now
for the first time protest from the spectators began to
rise even above the din of the fight. At the same
moment from scouts in the rear guard of both armies
came the watchword of the West Side, “Cheese it!”
In an incredibly short space of time both gangs were
rushing at top speed back toward their respective
gathering places. When everything was quiet, two
policemen turned the corner, walked solemnly down to
the middle of the block, and returned. There were, of
course, no arrests. One gang had rallied at a point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
about 100 yards to the west of the avenue, and were
starting back to the battleground again when two small
boys concealed in a cellarway at the corner shrieked
out another warning. The gang broke up again and
the next minute a discomfited policeman stepped out
from a doorway where he had been concealed and came
along the street.</p>

<p>At the corner of Ninth Avenue two men were indignantly
discussing the fight. “Those boys do more to
ruin property and lower real estate values around here
than any other three causes,” said one of the men.
“They’re having these fights continually now and they
seem to grow worse all the time. Suppose that some
passerby had been in the way of that revolver which
was shot down the street just now. Nothing could
have been done. You can’t find out who had the revolver.
The police won’t try to make any arrests, and
if they do, the boys are always let right out again.
The insurance companies won’t insure plate glass in
this neighborhood any more, and the whole place seems
to be just at the mercy of these little ruffians.”</p>

<p>On one occasion a gang was short of bonfire material
at election time. The members raided a neighboring
street, took the gang there by surprise, extinguished its
celebration bonfires, and carried the wood in triumph
back to their own street. War was immediately declared
by the despoiled, and a regular after-school campaign
followed. Through an injury to one of their
number the gang in an intervening street became involved,
and sided with the bonfire stealers. War then
became general and for a year was a constant subject
for discussion among old and young in the neighborhood.
The boys of the defensive gang more than held
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
their own. They descended upon the allies from the
intervening street and vanquished them on their own
territory. They fought with even honors in foreign
territory the gang which originally started the trouble,
and repelled several invasions decisively. Finally these
terms were offered: The defensive gang formally notified
their opponents that if they could succeed in
forcing their way from the upper avenue to a Roman
Catholic church about three-quarters of the way down
the street, they would accept defeat. Night after night
the gang thus challenged made the attempt, but never
succeeded.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Early Lessons in Craps</span></p></div>

<p>It is not uncommon for fights to end by a formal
match between two opposing leaders, though very often,
particularly if the leader of the weaker gang wins, these
conflicts are indecisive because the stronger gang will
not accept defeat. In one case two gangs entered into
a formal truce because one gang was obliged to go
through the other’s territory on the way to school, and
found it inexpedient to fight a battle four times a day.
The other gang recognized the justice of this position
and according to compact permitted their enemies to
go through the street unmolested throughout the school
year.</p>

<p>Tales of this kind could be multiplied almost indefinitely,
for the exploits of boyish gangs dominate the
West Side problem. Such headlines as</p>

<p>are comparatively common in the newspapers; yet
most of the occurrences of this kind in the district
never reach the ears of a reporter. The following is
from the press account of a typical gang war:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>BOY STABBED BY YOUNG FEUDISTS</h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Is Second Hurt</span><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>This is the second boy to receive serious injuries
because of the feud which has been raging for the
last three weeks between stone-throwing bands of
boys who live in the vicinity of Fiftieth Street and
Tenth Avenue.... Fifty or more boys have
received injuries.... Not only are the lives of
school children endangered but the size of the
weapons used makes it perilous for adults to venture
near during the battles. There are a half
dozen bands in the neighborhood, and when any
two of them meet there is a fight. The principal
pastime, however, seems to be in a whole crowd attacking
one or two boys who belong to another band.</p>

<p>Teachers in the public schools and Sunday
school teachers have joined in the demand that the
Police Department give full protection against assault
to all living in the vicinity. The fever for stone
throwing seems to be spreading through all the
territory between Ninth and Tenth Avenues between
Fiftieth and Sixtieth Streets, and the situation
is said to be beyond the control of the present
force of police on duty in that part of the city.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gang fighting is most prevalent when the nervous
youngsters are just released from the school room and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
must inevitably encounter their schoolmate antagonists
on the streets.</p>

<p>Here is an account of a gang fight, the events of
which were described by one of the small marauders:</p>

<p>“Last night a gang of boys came down with their
pockets full of brickbats, looking for Willie Harrigan,
but Johnnie and Jimmie heard of it and got the gang
together. I came up with my pockets full of stones
and was throwing them when I got hit in the leg myself
and it hurt so I couldn’t throw. Just then three cops
suddenly jumped off a car, right in the middle of the
fight. Everybody beat it, but a cop grabbed me and
I dropped my stones and jerked away and ran. They
caught three of the others though, and took them to
the station house. I don’t know whether they got
there. Every afternoon this gang comes down and
tries to catch our fellows alone as they did with Willie.
We fight with stones and bottles. No one has been
very much hurt lately. One of our gang has a gun,
too, but he can’t fire it for fear of the cops.”</p>

<p>These last sentences reveal, or at least refer to, the
most repulsive of all the ways in which the demoralizing
effect of West Side gang development is shown.
Even a confirmed pessimist, if he has any sympathy
with boys and any knowledge of their ways, can discern
in the gang’s activities a striving after the unattainable
which is yet a birthright, an effort which is
essentially more pathetic than vicious. In the raid and
the “loot,” the chase and the “hang-out,” it is not
difficult to mark the trail of the Redskin and the hunt
and the lure of danger which is so dear to the heart of
a boy. But even the most persistent of optimists,
willing to make many allowances, must demur against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the coldblooded and treacherous methods to which the
feuds and enmities of West Side gangs have reduced
their members. If ever these boys had a sense of the
spirit of fair play, they seem to have lost it completely.
They win by planning overwhelming advantages. An
attack upon three or four or even one defenseless boy
by 30 or 40 merciless youngsters, who even attempt
to surround their prey and strike from behind,
is not a disgraceful thing to them but an exploit to be
proud of. No mercy is shown to the vanquished.
Stories are rife in the neighborhood of boys of thirteen
or fourteen being attacked when alone and undefended,
by 10 or more assailants from another street.</p>

<p>That casualties are not more frequent is due to the
dominant spirit of cowardice with which the mob
always taints its members. In the thick of the fight
when no responsibility can be placed and every member
feels secure in the presence of his friends, there is
no atrocity which these boys will not attempt; but
relying as they do on the strength of the mob instead
of on individual strength, the first feeling of timidity
immediately develops into a panic. An unexpected
move by the enemy at bay will rout an attacking party
of four times their strength. Half a dozen boys caught
at a disadvantage will charge unscathed through a gang
of nearly two score, who fly in all directions at this unexpected
display of bravery. One boy, for instance,
was recently beset by eight others when he was about
to leave the factory. Instead of retreating as they expected,
he suddenly seized a club, charged one wing
of his assailants, and escaped unhurt. On the other
hand, here is a case in which one of the victims was
caught:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>“Jim and me was goin’ down the street, w’en about
six fellers from the Fiftieth Street gang hot-footed after
us. We ran but they got right close and hollered to
us to halt. I made out like I was goin’ to stop but got
a fresh start w’en they slacked up and got away. Jim
did stop and they near killed him, they beat him
up so.”</p>

<p>“Oh! They would-a killed me if they’d got me,”
said one boy, relating how he had been chased into a
hallway by five or six of a rival gang, armed with
bottles, clubs, and bricks. “I hid in a toilet, and when
they came up to look in I rushed out on ’em and took
’em by surprise; I pushed one feller down the steps
and beat it, but they didn’t catch me.” And a similar
story was told by another. “After I wins in my fight
with bot’ Mike and his pal me little brother hears ’em
telling one day how they was goin’ to lay for me in the
hallway wit clubs. I runs up tru de house next door
on the roof tru de house where dey was goin’ to lay for
me and hides in the toilet wit a big club. When I hear
Mike and his pal come in an’ talkin’ right near me I
rushes out and bangs right an’ left wit me club. I hits
’em bot’ on de bean (head) an’ dey runs out. After
that they never bothered me.”</p>

<p>Gang fighting, in fact, as practiced in this neighborhood,
is conducive to neither manliness, honor, courage,
nor self-respect. The strength of the boy is the strength
of the gang, and under its protection unspeakable horrors
take place for which it is impossible to place responsibility.
Rumors of boys being stabbed, shot,
clubbed, maimed, and even killed are current everywhere,
and there is good reason to believe that many
of them are true. Such things are, of course, never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
mentioned to strangers, and residents learn of them
only by chance conversation. The moment that any
definite questions are asked, the boys become reticent
and change the subject. But there can be no doubt
that many crimes are committed in these blocks which
never reach the ears of the police, and that a considerable
proportion of them are due to the boy and his
gang.</p>

<p>And so the word “gang” here has grown to be synonymous
with the worst side of boy life, and the group
itself, which might in other surroundings and under
other traditions be a positive civic asset, simply adds
the irresponsibility of the mob to the recklessness of
youth and becomes a force which turns West Side boyhood
into cowards and savages. As a priest of one
of the Roman Catholic churches said the other day,
“The social evil may be an important one, but <i>the</i>
question in this neighborhood is that of the gangs.”

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="large">HIS HOME</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> the influences which mold the destinies
of the West Side boy one still remains to be
mentioned. We have tried to sketch the characteristics
of the community in which he finds himself
and to indicate the causes and the traditions which have
produced them. We have watched him in the daylight
glare of his playground, and followed him through his
games and the maneuvers of his gang. School, and in
later years, the shop or factory, rarely work any appreciable
change in his make-up. The former is usually
treated by the class of boys with whom we are dealing
as a long game between himself and the truant officer.
The latter comes into his life too late and often too
unsuitably to be regarded by him as anything but so
many dreary years of necessary imprisonment. But
back of his chequered little life on the docks and
streets stand his mother and his tenement home, and
surely it is to them, if anywhere, that we must look for
the guidance that is to help him and the influence that
is to counteract the wild persuasions of the playground.</p>

<p>Is this home attractive? Can it be? Does his
mother understand her boy and his difficulties, even
if she can cope with her own? If she does, how far
can she help him? If she does not, how far is she
blameworthy? What is her attitude toward the
West Side problems? To what extent is she&mdash;can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
she be&mdash;responsible for her children’s conduct? How
far right are the judges of the New York children’s
court, and how far wrong, in holding West Side parents
responsible for the misdemeanors of their sons?
Let us look at the home outside and within, visit the
mother and hear her side of the story; for these are
questions which must be asked and answered before our
picture of the West Side boy is complete.</p>

<p>It would be impossible with any truth to call the
tenement buildings externally attractive. Surrounding
the factories on all sides, wedged between tall,
noisy buildings, standing almost alone in a block of
lumber and wagon yards, or sometimes occupying
entire blocks to the exclusion of everything else, they
rise singly, in groups, or in rows along the streets and
avenues, ugly, monotonous, of an indistinguishable
sameness. Most of them face squarely up to the
sidewalk, with no areaway in front, behind them
narrow cement-paved courts, round which the shabby
walls rear themselves, cutting off sunlight and giving
to each little well of air-space the gloominess of a
cañon. Every type of obsolete dwelling, condemned
by the building laws of a decade ago, is present in
block lengths, teeming and seething with human life,
and accepted with that philosophy of poverty which
holds that such things are a part of the natural scheme
which created Fifth Avenue for the man who doesn’t
have to work and Eleventh Avenue for the man who
does. The “dumb-bell” and “railroad” types of
tenement with dark inner rooms, first sanctioned by
the laws of the late 70’s but condemned as dangerous
and unsanitary nearly a decade ago, predominate.
These buildings were erected for the most part over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
twenty-five years ago (some are forty years old or
more), and in the ten years preceding 1911 only two
modern tenements had been erected in the whole district.
Most of the tenements so adjoin that the roofs
of one are accessible from those on either side. Frequently
this condition continues through the whole
block, so that a marauder, a fleeing small boy, or a
fugitive from justice, may dodge up one stairway,
cross several roofs, and descend by another. Similarly,
if one street door is locked, the tenement can
usually be entered from the adjoining building by
way of the roof.</p>

<p>Inside, the tenements offer a depressing study in
bad housing conditions. The hall is dark, the stairway
small and ill-lighted; modern toilet and sanitary
facilities in many cases are absent. The rooms are
often infested with mice, roaches, and bed-bugs. The
slender airshaft is frequently so inaccessible that refuse
and rubbish thrown into it from adjacent windows
may lie for months in a rotting accumulation at the
bottom. A large proportion of the families are herded
in flats containing from two to four rooms, which are
very small and receive a minimum of light and air
from their few and often overshadowed windows.</p>

<p>The number of rooms occupied by 200 of these
families, as shown by the table given in the Appendix,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
is to some extent misleading, for the rooms are often
not really separate. Owing to restrictions of space
there are rarely doors between the rooms in the prevailing
type of tenements; only doorways; and whether
these are hung with curtains or not, privacy within the
home is naturally almost impossible. Family quarrels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
or Saturday night’s drunken brawl too often take place
in the presence of the children. Moreover, walls are
so thin that every word spoken above an ordinary tone
of voice is plainly audible through them to the inmates
of the next flat. A social worker who was for a time
resident here said recently: “In the first part of this
month there were three cases of wife-beating in one
tenement alone. This tenement is of so-called ‘model’
construction, has an exceptionally high rent, attempts
to restrict crowding, and prides itself on an extra high
grade of tenants. Yet the quarreling and brawling
between husband and wife in all parts of the building
seem to be incessant. It even breaks the sleep of the
children and other tenants in the early hours of the
morning.”</p>

<p>In homes like these it is scarcely possible for even
the smallest families to live in decency. But small
families are not the rule on the West Side. Of the 231
families for which information regarding the number
of living children was secured, 163, or 71 per cent, had
four or more children. Families having five children
formed the largest group; and one family had 11
living children.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Day begins for the housewife at 6 o’clock, or even
earlier if she works outside the home, and ordinarily
her children are up and on the streets by half past seven.
For breakfast she usually prepares a quantity of food
and leaves it at the disposal of the family. The members,
as they rise, successively go to the kitchen and
help themselves. The workers go to the stores and
factories, and the children to school or the streets. By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
half past seven the factories are in full operation, the
stores are open, and the day’s work has begun. From
half past eight to nine, the streets are thronged with
children going to school, or sometimes to steal a riotous
holiday on the streets and docks as truants. At noon
they return to snatch a hasty lunch served in the same
impromptu way as breakfast, and then the woman is
left alone again to wash and cook and mend and gossip
till supper time, if she is not one of the many West Side
mothers who must go out to earn.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> In that case, the
household tasks must be done after she returns home
at night.</p>

<p>Such is the average tenement home, abiding place
of our West Side boy and his family. In a very large
number of cases the family is a “broken” one.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>As regards ambitions and ideals, the word “home”
may stand for anything from the thrifty German household
with its level head for the budget to a down-at-the-heels,
loose-hinged group of people who share
the same abiding place, but scarcely claim the name
of family. Of course, it must be remembered that
this is a neighborhood from which the sturdiest, those
having the lucky combination of prosperity, vigor,
and ambition, have pulled away. They have shaken
clear both from the ill-repaired and inconvenient
houses and from the district’s reputation for “toughness.”
Here and there a fairly well-to-do family has
been held by the ownership of a business or a house,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
or because to be a power even in a block like one of
these is more satisfying than to be second elsewhere.
Others have stayed from inertia, shaking their heads
over lax West Side customs, but on the whole accepting
them with the acquiescence of habit; and naturally,
on the level of the neighborhood, they have entered
into its life and made their friends here. They will
drift back after brief outward excursions, from sheer
loneliness. But most commonly the people here are
too strongly fettered to break loose; they are bound
to these dreary surroundings for their lives.</p>

<p>Practically every family has rubbed elbows with
poverty too familiar for comment,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> or seen it close
at hand among the neighbors in the house and the
children who play with their own on the street. In
many families poverty is a basic condition underlying
their many catastrophes and the whole tenure of their
unstable fortunes. Often the budget simply cannot
be stretched by any system of economy to cover the
requisites for healthy and sturdy growth. Such
requisites become luxuries, too extravagant for many
a child. Teeth and eyes go uncared for, nourishment
is inadequate, and misbehavior may easily spring in
the wake of this negligence; often it does. For none
of these children is good air obtainable except in short
intervals. And very closely associated with the
moral indifference of many an adolescent boy are the
noise and overcrowding within his own home to which
he is accustomed from babyhood. Sleep in a stuffy,
dark bedroom, with two or three other occupants, has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
telling effect both on mind and body, and never from
morning to night are these tenements quiet. At the
very outset poverty destroys the possibilities of normal
development. The tenement child runs his race, but
it is always a handicap.</p>

<p>Facing these harsh circumstances is a set of women
who, though intimacy reveals among them varied
dispositions and abilities, have yet developed out of
the common experience many of the same ideas and
lines of action. To their share falls the heaviest
responsibility for the discipline and training of the children.
The father is in the background and may be
used as a court of appeal. Or perhaps he is to be
guarded against,&mdash;another source of anxiety to the
mother, who assumes the difficult role of “standing
between.” Among the more intelligent families he
usually has a decisive voice in important questions
as to school or work, and frequently he is the stricter
parent, and carries more authority. But the day-in
and day-out management and care is the woman’s.
These mothers of the tenements are confronted by
the same problems, and they conform to certain types
which it is not difficult to recognize.</p>

<p>Very familiar is the figure of the well-meaning
woman who has kept her own decency, not without
a struggle, but has proved hopelessly ineffective as a
mother. She is usually ill-equipped to conceive or
enter into the feelings of an imperious, self-absorbed,
and overstimulated youngster. Her very decency
has often forced her into a dull routine with a gray,
colorless outlook, out of sympathy with youth that refuses
to accept the shadows of her own overworked
and saddened lot. Many of these women came from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Ireland as mere girls, alone or “brought by a friend,”
to go into the drudgery of living out. Their working
days began in childhood. Mrs. Macy drew her own
picture: Herself a child of twelve, she started out
to “mind” children. “I had a little hat wi’ daisies all
roun’ the brim an’ ribbons hangin’ off the back with
daisies fastened on, and with one hand I was hangin’
on to a hunk of m’lasses candy. I sure was childish
lookin’ help but I held the job for six years.” Then
came the marriage “to get a home of my own,” followed
by those terrible first years of bitter disillusionment
and wretchedness. “He’d leave me alone in
the house of an evening&mdash;I’d never been used to that.
I was frightened, an’ I’d cry.” Soon child came after
child, probably with a quota early given to death,
and with those who lived arose the problem of their
rearing.</p>

<p>Almost at once the women are awakened to the
menace of the streets which become their common
enemy. “To keep the boy off the streets” is the
phrase everywhere repeated, pitiful in its futility.
For every contrivance or device is useless once the
boy has responded to their lure. The “fixed up”
parlor with its lavishness of staring rugs and curtains,
its piano, the symbol of many an hour’s toil and ambition,
or its phonograph, is exhibited by the mother
with much satisfaction. Yet it crops out that in
spite of these attractions Willie does not stay at home,
and that only for severe punishment is he “kept up.”
Or, where restriction is tried, a boy makes use of every
sort of subterfuge in order to escape. An errand, a
visit to a boy’s house, a club, even church, are the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
alleged destinations which really serve as a pathway
to the “hang-out” of the gang.</p>

<p>If such competition with the street is futile when
the family is comparatively well-to-do, what chance
has the mother with no such attractions at hand?
Her home consists of three or four dark, stuffy rooms,
destitute of carpet, or perhaps with a frayed strip
or two, and a meager allowance of shabby furniture.
There is no space for a separate parlor. The evening
meal, the one family event, is eaten in the kitchen,
perhaps in cramped quarters where each one takes
his turn for a chair. The very conditions which her
own standards impose, the fact that she “does not
bother with such like in this house,” has “no time
for comp’ny,” or “never set foot in one o’ them silly
shows,” cut her off completely from comprehending
the excitement and charm of the streets to which her
children yield so eagerly.</p>

<p>Some of these women have carried for years the
burden of a shiftless husband. With dumb patience
they accept their lot&mdash;there is always the fact that
“four or five dollars is better than none, an’ it means
a lot to me on the rent.” And when even this help
is lacking, it may be “he did used t’ be a good man
t’ me an’ in his day he’s worked hard in the slaughter
house. He sez I’d be pretty mean t’ turn him out
after all these years. He can’t last much longer, an’
it’s hard t’ know what’s right. Most every night
he comes up here done. We have to laugh at him
a good deal an’ so manage t’ get along.” A pretty
grim kind of humor, this. In such cases it is well
if the man is no longer there. Sometimes the wife
has mustered all her power of decision and made the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
effort to eject a chronic loafer from the home. “I
talked and I talked for years,” said Mrs. McCarthy,
“an’ he thought I wouldn’t do nothin’. I couldn’t
put him away, but I got the judge t’ make him keep
out of my home. ‘Don’t you never bother this woman,’
he sez. I had got to hate him so I couldn’t stand
it to look at him when I heard him come down the
hall to the door an’ me standin’ there over me irons
and me tub.”</p>

<p>The bitter lesson of endurance so well learned,
familiar as second nature, is repeated again and again
with sons who are too lazy to work and depend upon
the mother’s earnings for what they cannot get by
gambling or stealing. Often her force is spent. She
is weak, querulous, discouraged. To expect her to
stem the tide of outside forces which are molding the
boy into the nerveless or vicious man his father was
before him is to ask the utterly impossible. Perhaps
she will close her eyes, like Mrs. Gates, whose only son
has joined a gang of sneak thieves but who maintains
that “Jimmy is a good boy and never was no trouble
to me.” In her heart she knows there is something
amiss, but she turns a deaf ear to any hint of wrongdoing.
Sometimes the mother admits everything,
enlarging and complaining, but at the end sits weakly
back. “What can I do? What th’ b’ys does outside
they don’t bes aifter tellin’ inside, an’ I can’t be keepin’
tracks on thim all th’ toime.”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">One Diversion of the Older Boys</span></p></div>

<p>In the judgment of such mothers a boy’s good nature
makes up for serious dereliction. A fellow who is
thoroughly “in wid de push,” according to her is
“just wild like, not bad. He’s thot obliging and does
onything I ask about the house.” Many a slip is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
forgiven a stalwart fellow by the woman who is feeding
and clothing him if he brings in her coal, puts up
a curtain, and does not “answer back.” So great in
their lives is the dearth of common kindliness. When
he takes to his heels, she confesses to “feelin’ kind o’
lonely without Dan around,” and nine times out of
ten she welcomes him back when his spell of wandering
is over.</p>

<p>Too often, however, this good feeling is absent and
active antagonism and bickering marks the spirit
of the place called “home.” The mother who from
“feelin’ it her duty to talk to ’em though they don’t
pay no heed” degenerates into the “nagger,” and so
has taken the fatal step which makes impossible anything
like affection or harmony between her and the
boy. The result is always the same: the sullen fellow
slouching before the querulous, upbraiding parent,
resentful in every line, ready to jerk away snarling,
or to flash out in a pitched battle of tempers, leaving
behind bitterness, misunderstanding and anger. Sometimes
this shipwreck is accepted with a Spartan quiescence;
lifelong experience forces these women for mere
self-preservation into an endurance grown easier than
revolt. Yet the suffering is great, and these mothers,
inadequate and weak as they are, form one of the
most pitiful chapters in the story of juvenile delinquency.</p>

<p>But there is the woman, here as everywhere, who
refuses to fold her hands, who is alert and decisive.
She is not likely to be found in homes where the most
stringent pressure of want or overwork is felt. Yet
she is not of necessity the best educated or most refined.
She is always shrewd, with a keen perception of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
boy’s side of the story, but also with a very clear and
determined perception of her own. Very likely she was
born and brought up within a few blocks of her present
home. But the experiences of her own childhood
form no parallel to those of this generation. In her
day everything to the west of Tenth Avenue was open
playgrounds; truant officers were unknown, and an
arrest was a thing to be spoken of in whispers. Still
she has grown up with the district and has listened to
the current gossip. Her first axiom is that no knowledge
of a boy’s doings will come amiss; her second,
that such information cannot be expected from the boy
himself. Even among the best of women a system
of spying is carried on, although the wisest do not
make this apparent unless occasion demands, but
quietly “keep an eye on that boy.” It may be a
strong motive for staying in an undesirable block that
“If we go, James’ll just be back here an’ then he’ll
be out from under me.” They understand the fallacy
of moving to separate a boy from bad company,
unless one can go to a suburb, from which there are
difficulties in the way of transportation to the West
Side. When conversation among the boys can be
overheard they “take occasion to listen.” “I don’t
go out very much but I’ve me ways o’ findin’ out,”
says Mrs. Moran, “an’ they know they can’t fool me.”</p>

<p>The amount of credit to give to tale bearing and complaints
is a question to puzzle the shrewdest. It is
an important source of information, yet “you can’t
believe everything you hear.” The irate complainant
who fails to get the expected warmth of support from
maternal authority needs to realize that the life of the
West Side boy is one continuous fracas with the landlord,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the janitress, the corner grocery man, the “Ginnie”
paper dealer, and the “cop.” Complaints come to
the mother from all sides and are often unfounded.
“I had him up in the house for playin’ hookey, an’
I watched them fellows crookin’ the bolognie off the
cart myself, or I might a’ thought it was him.” Moreover,
it is understood that a boy has a right to expect
a certain amount of support from his mother. Her
defense is natural, but she cannot carry it too far or
a boy may lose all fear of restraint at home. One
mother told of hearing a youngster boast, “Aw&mdash;g’wan&mdash;tell
my mother&mdash;she don’t care what I do.”
“And that hurts,” she said with emphasis, “fer a boy
to give his own mother a name like that.”</p>

<p>Altogether “it’s no easy matter bringin’ up a boy
in New York.” Truancy and cigarettes are issues on
which many a judicious woman must confess defeat.
She knows that surface evidence is not to be taken.
The appearance of a boy at the proper hours with his
books does not prove that they have not been “kept”
in a candy store while the youngster had an eye on
the time. Smoking is still harder to regulate, and
though a youngster “don’t dare to do it in the house”
few women feel sure as to what happens outside.
One confessed to avoiding the issue. “I knew he
was smoking a long time&mdash;smelt it&mdash;but I never let
on. I thought he’d do it open if I did and do it
more.” Amusements which can safely be sanctioned
are hard to find. Pigeon flying almost always is
frowned upon for fear of accidents on the roofs and
because “them pigeons are the ruination of b’ys,
keepin’ them out o’ school, an’ into the comp’ny of
them big toughs as has ’em.” Every shade of opinion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
is expressed in regard to the “nickel dumps,” as the
moving picture shows are called. Some believe that
“them places is the worst thing that ever happened
to New York, settin’ b’ys to gamblin’ and stealin’.”
Others set upon them the seal of approval. “A b’y’s
got t’ do somethin’ an’ I don’t see no harm in a good
show that keeps him off the streets.”</p>

<p>It goes without saying that these families have no
very large sums of money to give their children, but
the wisdom of allowing a boy some spending money is
recognized. It is, in fact, far more essential than in
most communities, for here almost everything desirable
must be paid for, from carfare to a ball ground
to the highly coveted coin for a nickel show. Money
is usually given to school boys in small quantities and
for definite things. “If he gets a quarter a week,
he doesn’t get it all at once.” And the boy must show
that it was spent as intended. With the boy who is
working, the amount he contributes to the household
is an important basis of judgment on his character.
If he works regularly and hands over his envelope, he
may still have peccadilloes, but his main duties are accomplished.
If, on the other hand, he is “wise” and
“deep,” he will lie as to what he is earning and keep
more than is thought to be his due. Or, all too often,
he will scorn work altogether and his mother will be
known to “have had bad luck with that boy.” The outsider
often expresses pity for the child who must hand
over the bulk of his meager earnings. But the moral
sentiment of the neighborhood insists upon this duty,
and with good reason, for the rearing of children is
indeed no easy matter here, even when it has not gone
much further than supplying necessities. Often the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
price paid in weariness, pain, and ill-health has been
sore, and the slight help that the child can contribute
after the long years of waiting is the father’s or
mother’s due.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when a boy reaches working age, some
allowance from his earnings is his by right, and it is
this fact which adds to his desire to leave school early.
During the first year, when the wage ranges from $3.50
to $5.00 a week, an allowance of 50 cents seems to be
general. Occasionally, 25 cents is considered enough,
but this is generally felt to be “stingy.” At the same
time, “it is not for a boy’s good havin’ too much in his
hands.” Sometimes he has $1.00 a week and buys his
own clothes. Lunch money and carfares to work are,
of course, allowed extra. Tips are generally accorded
to be his own; it is a mark of high virtue to surrender
them. A woman will tell with pride, “He knew I was
hard up and he gave me his tips.” Occasionally a
mother dislikes to have her son working in a place
where he is tipped, because it is then impossible to
know how much money is rightfully his. He can
account very easily for the possession of a surplus. The
amount a boy is spending is always a matter on which
a canny mother “has her eye.” Any doubt brings the
sharp question, “Now, where did you get the money
for that?” If he is unduly “flush” he is on the borderline
of danger, and her suspicions are keen. She knows
that the temptation to petty theft is constant. As his
wages rise his spending money increases, and if he still
lives at home at the age of eighteen or nineteen he
usually ceases to hand over his earnings but pays for
his board. With this increased independence comes a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
general feeling that the time of subservience is passing
and that “you can’t say much to a boy of that age.”</p>

<p>On the whole, this type of mother is lenient and
broadminded, realizing that “you can’t keep a boy tied
to your apron strings,” and too sensible to set up any
impossible standards. But the wisest of them know&mdash;and
rare and valuable, indeed, is such wisdom&mdash;that
once a boy has passed the boundary line, punishment
must be meted out in no faltering or indecisive way.
“He don’t dare do that, he knows he won’t be let,”
spoken with a certain emphasis, carries weight, and
lucky is the boy who with consistency and firmness “is
not let.” But on the West Side such discipline is not
common.</p>

<p>Many of the mothers reflect the average opinions of
the neighborhood. They are rough-and-ready Irish
women who give themselves no airs and “don’t pretend
to be better than the people they was raised with”;
women with a coarse and hearty good nature, easy-going
standards, and, if occasion demands, a good assertive
tongue. As a rule, the burden of discipline sits
easily on their shoulders. “Oi juist drrive thim out&mdash;th’
whole raft o’ thim,” says Mrs. Haggerty, blessed
with eight children and four rooms. “Oi can’t be bothered
with th’ noise o’ thim, Oi’m that nearvous.” These
women are not necessarily “a bad lot” as the district
goes, but neither are they over-particular. If a boy
has no complaints from school, or has held his job and
managed to keep out of the hands of the “cop” for the
last few months, “he’s a good b’ye,” and any “wildness”
in his past can be excused and forgotten. On
the other hand, if he has happened to give “trrouble,”
the chance visitor is likely to hear the tale from A to Z
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
and, if the youngster has had the bad luck to be present,
with a good, round scolding for him thrown in.</p>

<p>There is little delicacy or finesse about this discipline;
it is of the hammer and tongs variety. In the vast
majority of these homes, even those of higher type, the
emotions rule at one moment with cuff and shout, at
the next with a caress or a laugh. No consistency is
maintained, and the clever youngster soon learns by
the signs when to duck and when to “clear out,” just
as a little later he learns the earmarks of the “dinny”
and knows when to “cheese it.” There is a constant
piling up of threats which mean nothing. When Joseph
boasts of his gang and their glories, “What, are youse
fightin’ with that crew?” Mrs. Dooley raps out. “You
just better not let me catch you or you’ll get all that’s
comin’ to youse.” But she can back him up as hotly
and unreasonably as she berates him, and the ill-starred
policeman who comes beneath the onslaught of her
tongue and within the range of her invective will find
discretion the better part of valor and do well to hold
his peace.</p>

<p>But most tragic and helpless of all is the mother who
has gone down before the vicissitudes of her life. She
belongs to the scum of our cities, accorded no respect and
scant pity, only the scorn of her more “decent” neighbor
of the tenements. She may still be holding her family
together, but is almost always weak and enervated.
Their unkempt and wretched quarters, their nomadic
wanderings from house to house and block to block,
reflect her own failure. The father may be the “better
of the two,” but without her aid he is almost always
incapable of keeping their heads far above water. Often
he is another of her kind, and both have become the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
victims of their own habits. Suspicion and surliness
may well be expected from such a family, for they have
often much to fear.</p>

<p>Yet it may be that even such a woman as Mrs.
Catesby, in her three barren rooms at the top of a rear
tenement shack on one of the far river blocks, will receive
you without questioning your right to enter and
to share her confidence. Perhaps it is a latent desire
for human intercourse, perhaps merely the spirit of simple
courtesy, so universal among the women of the
tenements. She is a slatternly little figure, dressed in
a shabby black waist that scarcely covers her, with a
tangle of frizzled red hair slipping over her face and
held in tether by an odd hairpin or two. Her cheeks
are pink, though the skin is loose and flabby, and her
eyes are watery but clear and blue. An empty whiskey
bottle on the table is a needless index to the chief interest
of her sordid life. But although she may not
share your opinions, which in her life have proved mere
extra weight and have gone overboard as valueless, she
is nevertheless very well aware of them. It is harsh to
term her effort to play up to your standards deception;
perhaps it is a genuine remnant of more decent aspirations.
“If company comes it’s then I’m bound not to
be clean. Now, don’t you look at the dirt in this
house.” The dirt is of long standing, but conventions
are appeased.</p>

<p>The picture of her life, her husband, and her children,
which the woman paints for you, is colored for
your benefit, and is not to be taken at its face value.
There are plenty of evasions and falsehoods. Yet the
poor shams which she raises to shield herself from your
criticism are pitifully weak defenses through which may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
easily be caught many an illuminating glimpse of the
dingy realities behind. Nor is her confidence difficult
to gain, once your claim to friendliness is established.
“Yes, once I was down to that children’s court. I was
that frightened they’d take the children off. They was
only ten an’ eight when they come in one day, Jenny
an’ Paul, with a man I’d never seed before. ‘Good
day,’ says he, ‘you’re Mrs. Catesby?’ ‘I am,’ says I,
‘but I’ve never had the pleasure.’ ‘No,’ says he, ‘I’m
from the Gerries, and I’ve come for the children.
They’ll have to come along with me.’ I was that upset
I a’most fainted an’ I was all shaky like. Well, I
went out to call papa,&mdash;he had work that day,&mdash;an’
when we come back, he’d took them clear off just like
they was. He’d even left their little caps, an’ there
they was, layin’ on the table. There’d been a complaint,
I found out, yes, a complaint about how papa
was drinkin’ too much, but we got ’em back all right.
Wouldn’t it been awful if they’d been took!”</p>

<p>Sometimes the family is broken up, the children are
carried away, and the parents left to drink out the rest
of their lives as they will. To remove the children may
seem high-handed and brutal, but the reverse picture&mdash;the
family left to vent its weakness and its vice on the
plastic children in its care&mdash;is surely a worse alternative.
Some of these women are known as “harborers.”
They send the youngsters out to beg, and wink at their
pilfering if they do no worse. School in their eyes, as
in the boys’, is an unnecessary regulation and enforced
by an arbitrary society. Evasion of law is part of their
code, quite as much as is the “working” of any organization
or church, which is legitimate prey if there is
something to be gained. Beyond the calls upon their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
children to gather coal and wood and to mind babies
there are few restrictions. “Lord, I can’t be aifter
botherin’ me heads over thim, lady, they do be off
somewheres an’ ye can thrust thim younguns to take
care o’ thimselves.” And take care of themselves they
do, and quite effectually, until they have the bad luck
to run foul of the police. Even then it is probably no
very serious matter till Tommy gets to be an old
offender. His mother at least is not worried about the
condition of his morals, and can be counted on to give
the most glowing character to “the Gerry man.” What
need to fear the streets for him? Surely they can furnish
him few sights more sordid and more impressive
to his childish imagination and prematurely sharpened
mind than those with which he has grown intimate
within the walls of his “home.”</p>

<p>Truly they have a hard life, these West Side tenement
mothers, and though many fail and many despair,
from first to last the majority make a brave fight of it.
When one is born to the lowest rung of the ladder and
lives among people who seldom aspire beyond, existence
becomes a difficult matter. How can the boy’s home
be attractive when there is scarcely room to turn round
in it, the family is large, and when year in and year out
his mother is merely a drudge? How can his mother,
under such conditions, hope to make the home rival the
ever-changing lure of the streets? What time and
mental energy can she give to her children separately,
when she is struggling from morning till night to clothe
and feed them? Is the child, produced as he is, so
much her fault? Is he not much more a product of a
situation for which her responsibility is small?</p>

<img id="i_113b" src="images/i_113b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Rich Find</span></p></div>

<p>Home conditions, the tension of constant quarreling,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
broken sleep, fear, hatred, and excitement, combine to
break down the nervous constitution of the child before
it gets a fair start. Little is known or cared about
infant nutrition; there is no time to bother over such
things. In many families not even once a day is there
a regular meal or meal time. Father and children eat
the same food, and the boy is accustomed to the stimulus
of tea and coffee from childhood. Sugar comes from
the grocery fairly clogged with flour. The coffee contains
barley and other cheap ingredients. Cheap jellies
and condiments poison him with their acids and coloring
materials. The owners of delicatessen stores say in
defense that it is not worth while to keep the higher
grade brands for the neighborhood will not pay the few
necessary cents extra to secure them. A storekeeper
recently advertised a keg of cider for sale at one cent
a glass. When asked for his reason, he said that the
cider was so spoiled that nobody but the children would
buy it. While he was making this explanation two
small boys came in; one gave his penny to the storekeeper
and received a glass of cider which he shared
with his mate. Often the home food is not sufficient,
and it is not at all uncommon for a boy to pick up at
least one meal a day in the streets, leaving the house at
noon and not returning till late at night. Crushed fruit
and stale cakes and rolls are sold to children at half
price, and the stalls provide candy which, like the staple
foods of this neighborhood, is usually adulterated. But
the boys care for quantity rather than quality. The
mixture of glue, glucose, aniline dyes, and coarse flour
which they eat would upset the digestion of children
far better nourished than they, and most adults find it
impossible to drink the soda water flavored with cheap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
compounds which is sold on the streets. It is scarcely
to be wondered at that boyhood on the Middle West
Side is physically and morally subnormal; and it can
scarcely be contended that West Side motherhood is
greatly to blame for it.</p>

<p>If there is cause for wonder at the results of the home
life of these tenements, it is wonder that parents do not
give up more often. For here indeed it does seem that
“the struggle naught availeth.” Perhaps they do not
know how to give up. Their ethical sense, even their
sense of life itself, is dulled or deadened by the hopelessness
and squalor around them. The father’s struggle
to meet the rent, provide food and occasional clothes
for the family, and still leave enough for the hour or
two at the saloon, which is often his only recreation;
the mother’s pitiful, incessant effort to keep her dingy
tenement habitable and her family together; to make
one penny buy the groceries of two; and withal to keep
up to some slight extent a decent appearance,&mdash;these
things have left scant time or energy for attention to
the moral needs of the children. So long accustomed
to the dangers of the streets, to the open flaunting of
vice, drunkenness, and gambling on all sides, they do
not take into account the impressions which these conditions
are making upon young minds, now and with
ever-growing inquisitiveness seeking information and
experimenting on all manner of things which come
within their ken. Their very poverty itself aids in
dimming the moral sense. Mothers frankly say they
have no room for their children in the house, and it is
nearly always true. They are between the devil and
the deep sea. Physical and moral conditions in the
home are bad for the boy; the street gives him more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
light and air but is more dangerously immoral. In the
face of so many apparently insoluble difficulties is it
surprising that the parents’ attitude is bewildered and
discouraged?</p>

<p>From the midst of this squalid and disjointed home
life one fact emerges&mdash;that the recreation of the West
Side boy lies beyond the power of the family. To
look to such homes as those of this district to counteract
the tremendous forces that play upon him outside
is as unreasonable as it is useless. Wretched as it is,
the tenement home has an influence, usually vaguely
restrictive, and in a few cases wise enough and strong
enough to help a boy who is “steadying down” and
“getting sensible”; but this influence can rarely bear
the strain of competition with the pull of the street and
the gang. And so it happens that one type of mother&mdash;most
pitiful because so near to efficient motherhood
and yet so far from it&mdash;is perhaps the saddest of them
all; the type that is fully alive to her son’s dangers, but
realizes that it is impossible for her to cope with them.</p>

<p>Let us repeat, it is the inadequacy of the tenement
home that is the greatest curse of these blocks. Its lack
of space for storage helps to force uneconomical marketing;
its lack of size and equipment drives the boy to
the street. The mother is compelled to become her
own boy’s worst enemy. She would gladly keep him
off the streets, but the very conditions of her drudgery
force him to them, and cut her off from the sympathy
which she knows she cannot show him. Of course, the
picture is not totally unrelieved. East of the tenements
are the brownstone houses, and both here and
in other parts of the district there are families which
form exceptions of kindliness and comparative success
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
in dealing with the problem of living. But by far the
most of our boys would recognize their own homes and
mothers in these pages. Dirt, frowsiness, dissoluteness,
darkness, and rags&mdash;these are too often known to him
from infancy. In the far West Side, home seems to be
the one place which the children desire to keep away
from.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="large">THE BOY AND THE COURT</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[This investigation was made in 1909-10. Since that time
great progress has been made in the children’s court of Manhattan.
The failure of the kind of treatment described in
Sections II and III of this chapter has been recognized by the
court and a great step forward has been taken in the reorganization
of its probation work. A number of improvements
give evidence of a genuine and growing desire to make the
work of the court more thorough and humane. These and
other modifications will be noted in detail by footnotes in the
following pages.</p>

<p>The description of court procedure here given is therefore
to be read with the fact always in mind that the conditions
described are those of several years ago. The account has
been included because the material relating to the court,
while partly out of date, is inextricably interwoven with the
material describing neighborhood conditions which are practically
unchanged. The improvements in the children’s court
have not yet had time to seriously affect the district.</p>

<p>A further reason for including some statements regarding
partly outgrown court conditions here is that they are not
wholly outgrown in other cities. There are still children’s
courts in other places which have no special children’s judge,
where parole is used instead of probation, and where the
records are entirely inadequate.]</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> foregoing chapters have reviewed the situation
back of the boy’s delinquency and have
shown that his difficulties are deeply rooted in
the whole neighborhood life of the Middle West Side.
It cannot be denied that the courts are a necessary instrument
in the handling of such lawlessness as we have
found to be characteristic of our tenement neighborhood.
But it must also be admitted that the unsupplemented
efforts of a court of law, however humane its methods,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
cannot be the ultimate answer to our question of what
to do with the West Side boy.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the neighborhood the
children’s court takes its place among the various forces
which influence him as wholly foreign. In the first
place, the point of view of the tribunal is strange to his
little savage mind. The judge is a sort of Setebos
whom the little Caliban, sprawling in his West Side
mire, both fears and scorns. In the second place, the
court building itself is far from the district and beyond
the range of his familiar haunts. After the boy is
arrested, he is taken to the children’s court by way of
the detention rooms of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. In his own estimation he has
made a notable journey by the time he reaches the court.
His parents, too, view the trip to court as a considerable
journey, which involves putting on their best clothes and
the spending of carfare. It may also mean the loss of a
day’s work and the possible loss of a job.</p>

<p>In order to make clear the experience of the boy in the
court, at this point we must give a brief description of
the growth, equipment, and processes of the Manhattan
Children’s Court and its allied agencies. Later we shall
examine some of the tangible results of this treatment in
individual cases from the West Side neighborhood.</p>

<p>As a first essential to an understanding of the causes of
arrest and the methods of the court, we must know the
legal definition of juvenile delinquency. Chapter 478
of the Laws of 1909 provided that “a child of more than
seven and less than sixteen years of age, who shall commit
any act or omission which, if committed by an
adult, would be a crime not punishable by death or life
imprisonment, shall not be deemed guilty of any crime,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
but of juvenile delinquency only.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The offenses,
however, are still registered in the court according to
the law violated. The clauses under which charges are
most frequently made are given below. The number of
the paragraph in the Penal Law containing the full
text of the law is given in each case.</p>

<dl><dt>Sec. 486 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>a. Improper guardianship (peculiar in that the child was
arraigned for the offense of his guardians).</dd>

<dd>b. Disorderly or ungovernable child (on complaint of
parents or guardian).</dd>

<dt>Sec. 720 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>“Any person who shall by an offensive or disorderly act
or language, annoy or interfere with any person in
any place or with the passengers of any public
stage, railroad car, ferry boat, or other public conveyance,
... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.”</dd>

<dt>Sec. 43 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>A person who commits “any act which seriously injures
the person or property of another, or which seriously
disturbs or endangers the public peace or health, or
which openly outrages public decency, for which no
other punishment is expressly prescribed by this
chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor.”</dd>

<dt>Sec. 1310 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>a. Petty Larceny.</dd>

<dd>b. Grand Larceny.</dd>

<dt>Sec. 405 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>Assault.</dd>

<dt>Sec. 1610 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>Peddling without License.</dd>

<dt>Sec. 1990 Penal Law</dt>

<dd>“Riding on freight trains; boarding cars in motion; obstructing
passage of car.”</dd>

<dt>Sec. 2120</dt>

<dd>Robbery.</dd></dl>

<p>Besides the violations of the penal law, violations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
the compulsory education law and of the child labor law
are frequently the ground of complaint.</p>

<p>The list of offenses with which our special group of
294 boys was charged agrees in the main with those
given above. The list of court charges<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> according to the
number of arrests for each is given herewith for the
whole group of 463 arrests.</p>

<p>As early as 1892, a law was passed permitting the
separate trial of children in New York City, but it was
not until September, 1902, that a separate court was
established in Manhattan in a building of its own at
the corner of Third Avenue and Eleventh Street.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The
children’s court, including all those sitting in the
various boroughs of Greater New York, is called the
Children’s Part of the Court of Special Sessions. The
court sits daily until the calendar is cleared.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The cases
before the court had to be rushed through with great
speed. In 1909, over 11,000 cases were handled by the
Manhattan court. This allowed the judge an average of
five minutes for a trial, including the most serious and
perplexing.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The court building, which was once the headquarters
of the Department of Corrections, has long been congested,
inconvenient, dingy, and unsanitary.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
room where the hearing is given is always crowded
and noisy.</p>

<p>An account of the court’s equipment is incomplete
without a word in regard to the detention quarters set
aside in its own building by the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. The detention home, with
dormitories and dining rooms, is given rent free. The
total expense of caring for the children temporarily in
the care of the society in 1909 amounted to something
over $20,000.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The total amount spent by the city for
court service in handling over 11,000 cases in 1909 was
$56,012.15. This averages $5.00 less per capita than
any other large city in the country.</p>

<p>The development of a probation system for juvenile
delinquents was of very slow growth in New York City.
The first probation law in New York state was passed
in 1901, but children under sixteen were excluded
through the efforts of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In 1903, a compromise was made
which permitted the appointment of an official probation
staff. Until the series of adjustments and improvements
recommended by the reports of the Page Commission<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
in April, 1910, was begun, the agents of the Society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the
volunteer probation societies did the only work approaching
probation in nature.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The court process,
however, was not probation, but parole, though until
recently the words were used as synonymous in the
court. “At the end of the period of parole, sentence is
suspended if the child has done well,” wrote Mr. Homer
Folks. “The term ‘parole’ as used in this court signifies
practically an adjournment of the case. The oversight
of the children on parole is not clearly separated
from the work of the agents of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Very early in the history of the court private efforts
were made to help the many children who, it was felt,
were not receiving adequate attention. The impulse
to reform and save the child, being largely moral,
naturally originated in the churches. The result was a
division of volunteer probation along church lines
which left its impress on the later developments of
probation work.</p>

<p>In Manhattan the first to enter the field were the
Catholics. The Catholic Probation League, incorporated
February 3, 1907, under the auspices of the St.
Vincent de Paul Society, was the appropriate sponsor
for the movement. The pioneer work had already been
done, however, by a small group of women known as the
Catholic Ladies’ Committee. After the formation of the
Probation League, its parole committee co-operated
with the ladies’ committee by taking over the cases
of the older boys. The committee took all the girls’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
cases and gave them especial attention. The members
themselves did the visiting, and at one time maintained
a paid worker. Some of them favored the establishment
of an official probation staff. They thought that
the willingness of volunteer agencies to shoulder the
entire burden was delaying this important move.</p>

<p>The Jewish Protectory and Aid Society had for several
years engaged in parole and probation work to a certain
extent. The society maintained a paid worker who
represented its legal authority as guardian of all Jewish
juvenile delinquents in the city and who was made a
special officer by the police commissioner. Until the
recent establishment of the Jewish Big Brother movement
he bore the brunt of all the visiting of Jewish
cases, and handled as best he could all the cases passing
through the court or paroled from the Hawthorne
School.</p>

<p>Before the founding of the Big Brother movement,
there was no organized effort in behalf of the children
of Protestant parents who passed through the court
and were not committed to an institution. Ernest K.
Coulter, clerk of the court, seeing the need of work
similar to that of the other two great religious groups,
induced a club of men in the Central Presbyterian
Church to promise that each one would act as “Big
Brother” to one court boy. The preliminary work was
carried on by the club for a couple of years, and the
movement aroused considerable interest. Other church
clubs also took up the work. In March, 1907, the
movement was reorganized, so as to be independent of
the churches. For a time the branches of the Young
Men’s Christian Association acted as “centers” while
neighboring church clubs acted as “locals.” Later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the alliance with the Association was severed, the work
becoming independent of sponsorship.</p>

<p>The Jewish Big Brother movement, modeled in
many respects upon the Big Brother movement of the
Protestants, was formally organized in February, 1909.
At first, this society took only the boys on parole from
the Hawthorne School, but later the work was extended
to include parole cases from the House of Refuge.</p>

<p>All these religious agencies,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> in contrast to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have
not been in any way connected officially with the court.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<h3>1. GETTING INTO COURT</h3>

<p>Let us follow a boy, accused of violation of the law,
through all the possible vicissitudes of a court experience
in Manhattan previous to September, 1910. The task
may prove tedious but not nearly so meaningless or
bewildering for the reader as for the thousands of
families who had to go through it every year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>Once arrested, he was led to the nearest police station,
followed by a throng of curious onlookers. At the station
house children were occasionally discharged, but
ordinarily their names were entered on the police docket
and the parents were informed. If no one was found at
home, a message was left with a near neighbor. Some
one must vouch for the boy’s appearance in court the
next day before he could be liberated. If the boy was
arrested in the evening, he might be taken directly to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
for detention and the parent notified to appear there for
the child before midnight or at court the following morning.</p>

<p>The law provides that in cases of delinquency which
do not involve a felony the police sergeant may accept
the word of the parent or guardian as sufficient surety
for presence at trial, without bail. However, the decision
is left to the discretion of the officer, and bail
was sometimes required for trivial offenses.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> There is
opportunity here for the local political “boss” to foster
the belief that he is able to help a friendless family,
and later to send his henchman to enlist the vote at the
next election. There was no evidence that the local
“boss” had any influence in the children’s court; it is
significant, however, that the people thought he had.</p>

<p>In one case the great political “boss” of the district
personally accompanied the mother to the court. This
was when Mrs. Hannon, apparently believing that it
was the thing to do, had “got up her ‘noive’” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
appealed to him at once, without waiting for her husband
to tell her. Furthermore, Mrs. Hannon triumphantly
pointed out, the boy who had been brought in
simultaneously with her son, was fined $3.00 “because
his father was not ‘in’ with the Senator” at that time.
In two other cases it was the aged mother of the “boss”
who seemed to have the deciding voice as to his actions!
There were other parents, one a saloon keeper, who
boasted that they could have secured aid if they had
happened to need it. One old woman resident said she
had “enough friends to get the boy off the gallus if
nade be!” These stories illustrate the Celtic feudal
relation which existed between the political sponsor of
the district and its inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Bail was seldom demanded at the headquarters of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
When the boy was once inside this building, the general
public could learn little of what went on except through
the annual reports of the society, a formal visit, or
reports from the families themselves. To many families
the functions of the court and “the Gerry,” as the
society is called after its founder, were indistinguishable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
amidst the irritating confusion of their court experience.
If any distinction was made, there was a dread of “the
Gerry man” (sometimes used as a “bogey”) which was
not felt regarding the court.</p>

<p>By 10 o’clock of the first court day following the
arrest, the boy was deposited by the society’s agents in
the waiting room on the second floor of the court building,
or brought by his parents to the court room. After a
tedious wait his name was shouted through the corridor
back of the court, and relayed to the waiting room.
He was then taken into the noisy court room, where he
stood one step below the witness stand while the officer
or complainants were sworn in and corroborated the
data on the judge’s or their own memoranda. The
judge had only a brief record of the arrest and charge
at this time, with an occasional verbal report from an
officer of the society or a volunteer.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> No investigation
of the case, individual or social, was made before the
trial. Our records contain cases which, had they been
investigated, would have shown feeble-mindedness,
adenoids, bad eyes, frail constitution, self-abuse, or
terrible home conditions. On the other hand, there
were cases where the character and family surroundings
of the child should have shown a severe sentence to be
unnecessary. Sometimes faulty records failed to show a
previous arrest and the boy’s word was taken that he
had never been in court before.</p>

<p>Following the accusation the boy was allowed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
speak for himself, pleading guilty or not guilty. He
stood on the top step, the center of a small group, about
three feet from the judge. The distracting noise of the
court room had at least one advantage; it prevented the
audience from hearing what was said. After the boy
had spoken, the mother or guardian might be admitted
inside the rail to speak to the judge. In some cases,
this privilege was refused. This constituted the distinct
grievance of a group of parents who were not all of low
type by any means. On the other hand, in two of our
worst cases the judge, ignorant of conditions, proved
susceptible to a shrewd appeal by the mother. It is
hard to see, however, how the court could avoid such
mistakes without an adequate investigating staff.</p>

<p>Occasionally the parents had engaged a lawyer, who
was semi-officially recognized by the court and who
collected what fees he could from the defendants. Sometimes
the engagement was due to the initiative of the
lawyer. In fully 80 per cent of the cases there was no
lawyer formally pleading, and even when one was
engaged he was in most cases unnecessary. The delay,
and the cost to defendants, would have been much
reduced if he had not been present. Since, however,
every case registered as pleading “not guilty” was
supposed to have had the opportunity of counsel, a
lawyer’s name was formally entered in the record after
every such case.</p>

<p>Before disposing of a case the judge might remand the
boy to the care of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children while an investigation was made, if
he were not sure of the proper treatment to be given.
Only flagrantly bad conditions show up, however, under
superficial investigation. A case was occasionally “remanded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
for investigation” in order to give the boy and
the family a lesson; a remand of this sort being in reality
a mild punishment. Since the reformatories have refused
short commitments, this has frequently been the
substitute.</p>

<p>Unless the boy was an old case, it was only after the
court had acted and he had stepped down from the
stand that the volunteer probation agencies took a hand.
By this time the boy and his parents were pretty well
bewildered, and in the excitement it was often impossible
to make clear to them what was meant by the
questions asked or the suggestions offered by these
volunteers. The entire court experience meant for the
more sensitive among both parents and children a
nervous shock, or, at least, an extremely trying ordeal
which was frequently out of all proportion to the
triviality of the offense in question. Where the type
of family which passed through the ordeal with indifference
was concerned, it was correspondingly ineffective.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The kinds of disposition which the judge might make
of any given case are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Dismissal for insufficient evidence. Evidence
applies, as in criminal courts, only to the specific act;
and if it be lacking, the court is powerless to act as
guardian of the child as it could do if it had equity
powers. However, in especially flagrant cases a child
dismissed under one charge may be returned for improper
guardianship.</p>

<p>(2) Acquittal, if the boy pleads not guilty, and there
is some evidence that he was not involved in the
escapade. This is sometimes technical and takes no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
account of serious delinquency which may lie back of
the affair.</p>

<p>(3) Suspended sentence, after conviction, with a
warning of reprimand, but no supervision or visiting.</p>

<p>(4) A fine, usually one or two dollars, though it may
be as low as 50 cents or as high as five dollars. This is
used ordinarily as a lesson to the parents, since the
burden of the fine falls upon them.</p>

<p>(5) “Committed for one day to the parental care of
John Ward.” This is for the purpose of having an officer
give the boy a “licking” upstairs in the court, when a
parent refuses to do so. Occasionally sentence is suspended,
or fine remitted, on condition that the parent
do this, in case the boy or his parents have not learned
to say, when the judge asks the question that he has
already been licked. This method is said by some of the
judges to be very effective in preventing recidivation.
Its reforming effect is not quite so certain.</p>

<p>(6) Parole in the custody of the parents, to be visited
by the agents of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. A boy’s parole is often continued
month by month. At its expiration the boy may be
discharged from parole, committed to an institution,
or given a suspended sentence. In the case of school
children, especially truants, the principal acts as a
parole officer and signs the parole card daily, vouching
for the boy’s attendance and conduct. In case of serious
offense during this period, parole may be revoked, and
disposition made on both offenses, one sentence being
held in reserve for its deterrent effect. If a child and his
parents fail to appear on the prescribed date, a bench
warrant is issued and the child is arrested and brought
in. The same thing is sometimes done in improper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
guardianship cases, if the agent’s investigation has revealed
conditions unimproved.</p>

<p>(7) Commitment to an institution, if possible to one
of the same religious faith as the child. Neglected
children are sent to charitable institutions; delinquents,
usually older boys, after several offenses, violation
of parole, or serious incorrigibility, to one of the reformatories.
The House of Refuge is in many respects
a prison for minors. Boys are committed to it who cannot
be cared for by the New York Juvenile Asylum,
Catholic Protectory, or Hawthorne School. Truants, if
committed from this court, are sent to one of the truant
schools.</p>

<p>This résumé of dispositions forms a basis for a natural
division of our case material. We have studied the
effects of the court experience upon different groups of
children according to the sentence received. To a
large extent the home visiting was apportioned among
our investigators along the same lines. The disposition
indicates the judgment of the court as to the
seriousness of the offense, and it is the effect of this
judgment which is to be tested.</p>

<p>As has been stated in the introduction, a statistical
study of the delinquency of boys was made in 241 West
Side families. Four hundred and sixty-three arrests of
boys occurred among these families during the period
covered by our investigation. Data are available concerning
the offenses committed and the action taken in
court for 454 of these 463 cases. As some boys were
arrested more than once, and as some families had two
or more boys who were arrested, the 454 arrests affected
but 259 boys and 221 families.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>There were, in the families investigated, a number of
boys who were not themselves arrested, but who were,
nevertheless, properly included in our study of delinquency.
Their gang relations or other connections with
the boys who were arrested made their cases significant.
As these boys and the boys concerning whose arrests
complete statistical information is lacking numbered,
together, 35, the total number of boys dealt with is 294.</p>

<p>Not all the boys were really delinquent. Some were
brought into court because of improper guardianship,
an offense on the part of the parents rather than on that
of the children; and others who were not incorrigible
came to the notice of the investigators. The word
“delinquent” seems properly to apply to 249 of the 294
boys.</p>

<p>We shall divide the 454 arrests studied into three main
groups: (1) The group of 260 cases in which the court did
nothing after the child left its doors; namely, those
acquitted, discharged, released under suspended sentence,
whipped, or fined; (2) the group of 95 paroled
cases; (3) the group of 99 cases committed to institutions.
Each of these groups will be considered separately
in the following sections.</p>

<h3>II. THE BOY WHO IS LET GO</h3>

<p>The majority of the children who daily passed through
the court were dismissed either on the day of the trial
or, at the latest, after the rehearing a day or two later.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
We have recorded 260 of these cases, considered trivial
by the court and closed officially as soon as the offender
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
passed out of the door on Eleventh Street. As some
children were arrested more than once on these petty
charges, the 260 arrests affected 197 individuals and 176
families. In the words of the district, these 197 boys
were simply “let go.”</p>

<p>The district phrase does not discriminate between the
several verdicts under which this might happen. If
evidence was wanting to prove the child guilty of the
special act of which he was accused, he was “discharged.”
If, on the other hand, he was convicted, he
might still be allowed to go free with a “suspended
sentence,” under which he might be retried at any time
during the ensuing year. However, a retrial practically
never occurred unless the boy was rearrested under a
new charge. This fundamental distinction, then,
between innocence and guilt becomes a mere technical
difference and must be gleaned by the stickler for verbal
accuracy from the court records and the rulings of the
law. It is not to be discovered in the minds of either
parents or children. Both verdicts came to the same
thing in the end. “Aw, he got out a’ right the next day.
They couldn’t do nothin’ to him for a little thing like
that.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the boy was let go but a fine was imposed.
This was a fact never to be forgotten by his parents.
Several years after the event, the mother would recall
ruefully: “He cost me two dollars for that fine, he did&mdash;an’
him only standin’ and lookin’ on.” When the fine
was not forthcoming, the youngster might be held for
the day in the court building and then dismissed. Sometimes
the record reads “Committed for a day,” which
means that the culprit had received a trouncing from an
official of the court. But there was very little difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
after the lapse of a few months in the effect of these
verdicts, whether of discharge or suspended sentence,
because none projected themselves very far into the
later experience of the boy. There was some additional
hectoring at home and the full recital of events to
the gang. Then, with a few exceptions, the experience
became past history.</p>

<p>Owing to the thousands of petty cases which flood the
court the individual case was cursorily handled during
the hearing as well as afterward. There was seldom any
effort to probe deeper into the affair than appeared from
the version given by the little group before the bench,
consisting of the officer who made the arrest, the complainant,
if there was one, perhaps a friend or witness
who was interested and chose to be present, and the
boy’s parents. Sometimes the mother did not even
reach the bench, so great was the speed with which such
cases were reeled off. Very seldom was there any time
for patient questioning, without which the truth cannot
be obtained from a reluctant and fearful child or from a
parent already on the defensive. The disposition of the
case, according to the routine procedure, must be based
on an inadequate knowledge of the circumstances. On a
minor charge the judge would seldom utilize his right to
adjourn a hearing, and even this so-called “Remand for
Investigation” might be used merely as a light punishment,
since the child was kept for several days in the
detention rooms of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. It did not necessarily mean that
any further inquiry was made.</p>

<p>In so rough a hopper as our system of arrests, boys of
all sorts are run in on petty complaints. Of course,
many of the tales of needless and mistaken arrests must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
be taken with a large grain of salt, as the mother is
often quite ready to accept the boy’s version. But the
evidence of disinterested residents and social workers in
the district indicated the casual nature of many of the
arrests. An arrest was simply bad luck, like the measles.
“I ain’t been in court yet!” said Joey Burns. “I’ve
only been in court twice,” said Patrick Coogan.</p>

<p>Nor is the argument entirely against the “cop.” The
chances are that, if the boy wasn’t throwing craps then,
he had done it often enough before, and the policeman,
as the mother bitingly comments, “has got his job to
hold down.” In case of a bonfire or a fight, it is humanly
impossible to select from a horde of running boys the
exact one who threw the can or lit the match. An onlooker
is pretty sure to be hauled in and an angry woman
to be down around the officer’s ears with, “It’s a foine
sight of a strappin’ strong man ye are t’ be takin’ up a
poor innicint b’y an’ lettin’ thieves and sluggers get
away on yez.”</p>

<p>Yet there are important differences among these
boys arrested on a seemingly trivial class of charges,
such as “Loitering in the hallway of a house in West
Forty-ninth Street,” “Making a noise,” “Shouting and
creating a disturbance to the annoyance of the occupants
of said house.” The offender may be a weakling, frail,
ill-nourished, and backward. For this type of boy,
sensitive and timid as he already is by nature, the court
experience simply serves to increase his defect. Or, at
the other extreme, he may be the leader on his block,
and the prime spirit of all its “deviltry.” Hardened by
a long career of semi-vagabondage in the streets, this
boy is likely to be utterly scornful of the courts and their
discipline. But most of the boys brought in on minor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
charges belong somewhere between these two extremes.
Many of them are merely “wild,” like scores of other
fellows on their streets, and would have a fair prospect
of turning out well under proper supervision.</p>

<img id="i_141b" src="images/i_141b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Same Gang at Craps</span></p></div>

<p>It is safe to say that “delinquent” was a misnomer
for at least one-fifth of the 197 boys so easily dismissed
from court. On a conservative estimate, 39 of these
boys could not be charged with real misdemeanor, still
less with crime. The sum of their iniquity was the violation
of a city ordinance; they had “obstructed a sidewalk
of a public street while engaged in playing” some
game ranging from football to craps.</p>

<p>One boy, for instance, was arrested for pitching
pennies. His parents were sending him to high school
and had managed to give each of his older brothers two
years in a business college&mdash;facts which betoken in our
district unusual family energy and ambition. The boy
himself was the leading spirit of an especially vigorous
settlement club. His mother was firm in her protest
that “parents ought to be given a chance to punish
for such little things themselves.” Even the graver
offense of stone throwing, when traced to its origin,
does not always proceed from criminal instincts. The
course of public opinion on his block draws any spirited
boy, sooner or later, into some of the closely contested
fights which occur periodically in lieu of a better form of
recreation.</p>

<p>These charges are less a reflection of the boy’s waywardness
than of the community’s disregard for his
needs and rights. Apart from the misdemeanors which
brought them into court, these 39 boys were well up to
the best standard of behavior in the neighborhood. In
only one case was there any serious truancy and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
boys of working age all had steady jobs. The explanation
of their better behavior was to be found, for the
most part, in the better circumstances of their families;
for most of them lived in fair homes in the more
prosperous blocks of the district.</p>

<p>A few of this group, however, belonged to the most
heavily handicapped families of our acquaintance. One
boy, in particular, stands out for a degree of courage and
energy remarkable for his years. His name was Sam
Sharkey. His family lived on a river block from which
it was assumed that no good could ever come. “If the
rent’s paid, there ain’t nothing more looked for from
that lot,” was the neighborhood opinion of this particular
row. On the ground floor of one of these squalid
houses Sam and his mother kept up a home for the
younger brothers and sisters. Mrs. Sharkey scrubbed the
floors of the dental college and the boy drove a delivery
wagon. Sam was his mother’s steadfast right hand,
sharing every responsibility with her. During one
period of four weeks, for instance, while Mrs. Sharkey
lay in the hospital with peritonitis, fifteen-year-old Sam
kept up the home without her. “All the time I was out
of my head,” said Mrs. Sharkey, speaking of her hospital
experience later, “I was talking about Sam and
calling on him to do things. The nurse, she says to me
when I was myself again, ‘Who is this Sam that
you’ve been talking about all this time?’ says she.
‘That’s my boy,’ says I. And I was for getting up and
coming right home to help him, only they wouldn’t let
me.” This was the same boy who had been arrested
not long before his mother’s illness, for playing craps.
In his case there was great need of outside help and interference
of the right sort; but thanks to the marvelous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
stamina of young life still to be found occasionally even
in the depths of squalor, there was certainly no problem
of delinquency.</p>

<p>The largest group among the 197 boys discharged
from court, which numbered 96, were of the type which
the neighborhood characterizes as “wild.” This means
boys who are troublesome in school and are probably
truants. They are common nuisances, marauding on
streets and roofs, damaging property, lying, and pilfering.
Boys of this sort may be counted by the hundreds
through these blocks. There was nothing to indicate
that the 96 representatives who had been in court were
very different from their neighbors, except by their ill
luck in being “pinched.” It would be a desperate outlook
indeed if all the “wild” lads of the West Side were
likely to develop into the lawless Gopher element which
as boys they emulate. Still, for all of them the chances
are precarious. There can be no question, however,
that it is still possible to counteract the influences which
are hastening many of these boys along a criminal path.</p>

<p>The record of one twelve-year-old boy shows the
typical cross currents of influence which affect the boys
in this class. Hugh Mallory was the youngest of eight
children. During the first ten years of his life his family
had lived in the house in which he was born. Here they
suffered so much from sickness, death, and poverty
that they finally moved to another street, hoping to
“change their luck.” After this they were more prosperous
for a time until the father and one of the older boys
got out of work and things began to look less cheerful.
Mallory was a hard drinker, especially when out of
work. The younger children feared him when he was in
liquor, as it made him ugly-tempered. A special antagonism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
existed between him and the second son, who
would get out of bed even late at night and go out
on the streets if his father came home drunk and in a
quarrelsome mood.</p>

<p>Still, the family had “never had to ask help but had
had enough to eat and could get along.” James, the
oldest son, a young man of twenty-three, was the mainstay
of the family. The mother had done well under the
hard load she had had to carry. She was thrifty, making
all the children’s clothes, even to the boys’ jackets, but
she showed the effects of her hard life in both her thin,
worn appearance and her slack moral standards. She
was not above conniving at such pilfering on the part of
the boys as would “help along.” For two years Hugh
had brought home coal regularly from the neighboring
freight yard. Mrs. Mallory said that he was very smart
about it and showed with pride two large bags which he
had gathered. The method, she explained, was for one
boy to climb on a car and throw down the coal to the
others, who picked it up. She was, however, constantly
in fear lest Hugh should be arrested. The court records
showed that Hugh had never been brought in for stealing
coal, but he had been arrested for stealing old iron.
It was natural that “swiping coal for his mother”
should lead to “swiping” things for his own purposes.
Hugh and his fifteen-year-old brother were members of
a club in a Protestant institutional church. The club
had a camp to which both boys went in the summer.
They had to pay their railroad expenses, and got the
money, in part at least, from their winnings at craps.
The outcome for Hugh was hard to foretell. It was a
toss-up as to which of the elements playing on the boy’s
nature would ultimately assume the dominant place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
An effort to swing the balance with boys like these
seems thoroughly worth while.</p>

<p>Youngsters like these form a large group, and are
perhaps the most vulnerable point of attack for a court.
With those who are merely “wild,” the oversight
and help of a good probation officer should bring the
best results. Leaders in settlement clubs, Big Brothers
and social workers generally, agree that the problem of
the boy of this type, whatever his surroundings, is
largely one of wise direction of his sports and other
activities. If the families of the culprits and the social
agencies which have the welfare of the city boy at heart
could be brought into close co-operation with the court
through an efficient probation department, it is believed
that results would quickly be shown in the diminution
of the delinquent boy problem.</p>

<p>The remaining 62 of the group of boys let go presented
a less hopeful aspect. The court charge was not an
index to be trusted. Charges of petty theft were frequent,
and six burglaries were recorded against this
group. On the other hand, some of the boys, whom
we knew to be seriously delinquent, had been brought
before the judge for playing craps, building a fire, or
some equally trifling offense, and discharged. When we
pushed the investigation further, we found in the case
of all these 62 boys a situation whose elements already
foretold a useless if not a vicious manhood, unless
vigorous and sustained effort were made to rescue them.</p>

<p>Matty Gilmore, for instance, had been brought in on
the charge of “maintaining a bonfire on a public street.”
On nearer acquaintance, he proved to be a boy in whom
a definite criminal tendency was already noticeable. He
had never worked more than a week or two at a time in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
spite of the many jobs to which he had been “chased.”
In this he was carrying out the tradition of his family.
His father and three older brothers had always loafed
by spells “on” the mother and sisters, who worked
steadily.</p>

<p>One of the jobs he had held for two weeks was that
of delivering packages and collecting for the Diamond
Laundry. At the end of the first week, his employer
discovered that he was pilfering. Accused by the
manager, Matty confessed his guilt but earnestly declared
that he had been induced to pilfer by a friend of
his, “a bad boy,” who was also in the service of the
laundry and who was discharged forthwith. Matty remained.
On Tuesday of the next week, two friends of
his brought back a package with the tale that Matty had
been run over by a train and was too badly hurt to
work. He had entrusted them with the package to see
that it was returned. It was not until several days later
that the laundry discovered that Matty and his friends
had delivered all the packages but one that morning and
had pocketed the money collected. His mother and
sisters made good the laundryman’s loss and the boy
was not brought into court. A year later, he was
arrested for disposing of several gold watches which had
been stolen in a Connecticut town. As he was sixteen
by this time he was sent, after a week or so in the Tombs,
to the town where the theft had been committed, and
spent several weeks in jail awaiting trial. He was then
dismissed and allowed to come home again, where he
took up his old habits, lounging in the streets and
“hanging out” with the gang in its headquarters at
“Fatty” Walker’s candy store.</p>

<p>The transient court experience leaves perhaps a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
deeper impression on the mother than on the boy.
Many, to be sure, take it lightly enough and look upon
the whole elaborate system as a sort of adjunct to their
family discipline. “It was just as well,” one would say,
“Oh, of course, he plays now, but he did keep off the
streets there for awhile. I guess it did him some good,
scared him some.” As for its effect upon herself, this
type of mother is likely to show the indifference of the
woman who “don’t seem to mind, she has seen so much
of them courts.”</p>

<p>This statement does not necessarily mean that the
woman has been to the court repeatedly. A single experience
may go a long way toward inducing this state
of mind. Mrs. Tracy’s account of Michael’s trial, for
instance, shows how the cursory hearing given the
case was bound to diminish her respect for the court.
Michael’s actual trial, which was over in three minutes,
was the anticlimax of a distressful day. It had begun
with a hurried appeal to the local political boss, which
had been followed by a trip to the court under the direction
of one of his henchmen and by a long, anxious wait
at the court from nine in the morning until two in the
afternoon. And then, according to Mrs. Tracy, “The
judge says, ‘Officer, did you see the stone in his hand?’
‘No,’ says he. ‘Well,’ says the judge, ‘don’t bring me
any more cases like this.’ We none of us got a chance to
speak, me nor Michael, nor the man who made the
complaint, and who come down to court.”</p>

<p>But many cannot take it so philosophically, especially
those who work hard and are not so much in the drift
of neighborhood events and sentiments. They have not
heard enough gossip to regard an arrest as a necessary
episode and to discount its dangers. Instantly the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
fear looms up that their boy is to be taken away. In
the momentary panic, good women who have the welfare
of their children most sincerely at heart will falsify
to the judges without a scruple. A clergyman of the
district said that more than once he had heard the
same mother who had previously come to him in deep
anxiety concerning her son’s misconduct give him an
unblemished reputation before the judge. It rarely
occurred to one of these women that any real aid was
to be had from the court. To them it was simply
another of the many hardships which worried and
harassed their overburdened lives. Loss of time, and
perhaps of money for a fine, are a very real sacrifice for
the woman who works; but even these are nothing to
compare with their worry and distress. “I couldn’t
help crying, do you know, all the time I was there,
and it made me sick for a week.”</p>

<p>We have then to consider the result of this whole
cumbersome system of minor arrests and discharges.
On the whole, we were led to the conclusion that the
handling of minor cases in the manner described did
hold in check the trifling delinquencies, more properly
termed nuisances, especially in the better blocks. In
the poorer sections it was not very successful even as a
check on nuisances, as the casual passerby quickly
learned; and it did not seem to have the slightest effect
on serious lawlessness, where the need of restraint and
discipline was greatest. The hurried hearing, the slight
consideration, and the facile discharge were not only
ineffective but often positively harmful. There is no
getting around the fact that the court dealt with unjust
severity with some boys, while with others its very
leniency tended to make order and justice a mockery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>There is no simple panacea for all these troubles, but
in the immediate situation and along the lines of court
action some changes are worth trying out. The matter
of arrests is a difficult one to control; often no valid
distinction between the guilty and the innocent can be
made on the spot, and even the best of police are in no
way equipped to decide with certainty as to the degree
of an offender’s guilt. However, it would be better to
eliminate altogether a number of the most trifling arrests
rather than to treat the offenders in too cursory a
manner after they are brought into court.</p>

<p>The greater expenditure of time and money which a
more thorough treatment of those arrested presupposes
is an absolute necessity if we are to increase to any
marked degree the success of the court in grappling with
the real problem of delinquency. For this problem, as
has been indicated, the best solution undoubtedly is to
be found in the maintenance of an adequate and
efficient probation staff, whose duty it shall be to furnish
data concerning the situation back of the minor charges
as well as of the more serious ones, upon which the
judge may base his action.</p>

<h3>III. PAROLED IN THE CUSTODY OF HIS PARENTS</h3>

<p>As there was no official probation<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> in the children’s
court of Manhattan, the judges had to rely on volunteer
probation and what is known as “parole.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Under
the so-called parole system as it existed in connection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
with the Manhattan Court, no constructive effort was
brought to bear on the boy beyond reproof and advice
given in court and an attempt to impress him with a
fear of the consequences to himself if these were disregarded.
This method was used in cases deemed too
serious for immediate discharge, yet not suitable for
commitment to institutions. There are among our
records 95 arrests where this solution was tried. The
number of children concerned was 83; the number of
families, 76.</p>

<p>The procedure in such cases took more time and consideration
than when the child was simply discharged.
Sometimes the “parole” was granted on the day of the
first hearing without any previous investigation, but
usually the child was sent to the detention rooms of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for
two or three days to await a second hearing. During
this time an officer of the society made an inquiry and
brought a report to the court. If the judge then decided
to “parole” the culprit, he was sent home to his
parents, to whom the following card was given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Your child ..................., paroled in your custody
until ............, on which date you will report with h... at
the Children’s Court, 66 Third Avenue (Corner of Eleventh
Street), at 10 a. m. for further instructions from the Court.</p>

<p>“The disposition of the case will depend entirely upon h...
conduct while so released and your supervision over h....</p>

<p>“The case will be re-investigated by the New York Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children, and a full report
submitted on the date set for the return to Court.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The date set for his next appearance was generally
about a month later. Just before it arrived another
inquiry was made to form the basis of a new report to
the court. The officer of the society to whom the case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
was assigned had no responsibility for the conduct of the
child during this interval. His sole task was to discover
what it had been and to report it correctly. The judge
glanced over the papers concerning the previous hearing,
read the new report, and accordingly terminated or
extended the “parole.” As a usual thing it was only
two or three months before the forces of the law ceased
to concern themselves with the boy, and for the time at
least he passed beyond the oversight of the court. He
might have to report, perhaps once, perhaps four times&mdash;very
seldom more. In case of failure to do this, a
bench warrant might be issued on which he would be
brought in, but this happened very seldom.</p>

<p>A comparison of our 95 paroled cases with all the
cases, 1,805 in number, under the care of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children during 1909,
shows that the average period of parole was about the
same for both groups. Speaking in general terms, about
one-third of the children in each group were on parole a
month or even less, and at the end of three months the
parole was ended for all but a small proportion of the
cases in both groups. The inadequacy of the one to three
months’ parole is best indicated by comparing it with
the usual term of commitments. The institutions have,
by common consent, declared that a commitment of
less than one and a half to two years is not sufficient to
effect any real change in the character of the offender.
There is, then, little to expect in the way of actual reformation
from brief parole terms. Especially is this
true so long as they are not re-enforced by any direct
effort to modify the conditions of the child’s life or to
influence his character and conduct.</p>

<p>A second defect of the parole system was the important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
part played in the court’s decision by the written
word of the parole officer. Meager statements, even
when accurate in themselves, may be as misleading as
if they were false. Two reports placed in the hands
of the judge may, on the face of them, be not dissimilar;
but in the light of further investigation, one of the cases
may prove to be far more serious than the other.</p>

<p>An investigation too frequently was made as follows:
The parole officer secured the mother’s statement as to
the boy’s conduct, hours, and associates; the testimony
of the neighbors as to the character of the family; a
statement from the boy’s school; and, perhaps, if he
was working, a statement from his employer as to his
regularity, conduct, and quality of work. The following
is a typical record of such an investigation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This record concerns Patrick Staley, a boy of twelve, living
at West &mdash;&mdash; Street, “charged with disorderly conduct in
that he did climb on the rear of a truck moving through said
street and take and carry away merchandise, to wit: one jar,
containing a quantity of mustard.”</p>

<p>The report of the investigation reads: “Defendant lives at
the above address with his widowed mother, in a very poorly
furnished home of three rooms, where they have resided the
past two years. Mother of the defendant is employed as a
cleaner in Public School 51 where she earns $6.00 a week. This
is the only income of the family. Mrs. Staley was seen and
states that her son Patrick has been very well behaved since
arrested and paroled. Further states that he attends school
every day at Public School 51 and that he has no bad associates
that she knows of. Further states that he is never on
the street at night and is well behaved in and about the
house. Neighbors, all of the poorest class, state that the boy
Patrick is a good boy. No school record was obtained as there
is no school this week.”</p></blockquote>

<p>With every rehearing the same ground was covered
in the reinvestigation&mdash;a second interview with the
mother, the neighbors, the school, and possibly the employer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
In addition to the parole officer’s report, the
boy was supposed to present a card signed daily by his
teacher and parent. Of the full family make-up, its
history, the attitude of the parents, the temper of the
home, the character of the neighborhood, the boy’s
individuality and interest,&mdash;in a word, of the whole
vital human situation represented, nothing is to be
gleaned from the curt and general phrases of hastily
gathered reports. The importance, therefore, of insuring
complete and thorough investigation through the
employment of a trained staff of workers cannot be over-emphasized.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The following record, as brief as the one quoted above,
was based on a very thorough investigation by a
trained worker.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This report concerns James Riley, a boy of fourteen, living
in West 53rd Street, charged with creating a disturbance by
“throwing missiles and knocking off a man’s hat.”</p>

<p>The report of the investigation reads: “Defendant resides
at the above address with his parents in a fairly clean and
comfortable home of four rooms. Mrs. Riley was seen and she
states that her son has been very well behaved since on parole.
That he has been attending school regularly and has no bad
associates to her knowledge. Further states that he is never
out of the house evenings. Further states that her daughter
Mary practically takes care of the home and that she herself
is employed in Bellevue Hospital and her husband is a longshoreman.
Neighbors and janitress all speak favorably of the
Riley family and state that the boy James since on parole is
very well behaved in and about the premises and seems to
attend school more regularly. At Public School 82 the following
report was obtained: “Attendance satisfactory, conduct
excellent, work fair to good.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The two boys, the two homes, the two situations were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
radically different. Yet, although there may be no misstatement,
the cases of the boy James and the boy Patrick
appear, on the face of the reports, to be quite similar.</p>

<p>It does not follow from the brevity with which facts
may be presented that they are the sifted truth from
which the chaff of falsehood has been blown away.
And yet in gathering this kind of evidence, judicious
sifting is absolutely necessary. The word of the parents
must be considered and is of great importance, but it
cannot be taken on its face value. In a district such as
ours, with its marked hostility toward the forces of the
law, it would indeed be strange if a parent on the defensive
would choose to give reliable evidence rather
than evasive and misleading statements. And the more
serious the charge, the less reliable, naturally, is the
parent’s word. At best it is merely indicative of the
father’s or mother’s judgment, which is often too feeble
a staff to be depended upon.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, the testimony of neighbors is
open to question. The Bransfields, who had a reputation
from one end of the block to the other as being the
“toughest of the tough” were nevertheless, according
to court records, “favorably spoken of in the house.”
Thus, also, the parents of James Burckel were set down
as “to all appearances respectable. They are favorably
spoken of in the house. They have lived there for the
past four years.” Yet the father of James Burckel had
served three terms in prison. On the other hand, really
respectable parents deeply resent the stigma of having
the news spread through the house that a probation
officer has been inquiring about them. Evidence of
this sort, unreliable as it is likely to be for the court on
the one hand and mortifying to the parents on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
other, should be gathered only with the greatest care
and discrimination.</p>

<p>The school has been in the past, and must continue
to be in the future, one of the most important contributors
to the information of the court. Here is to be
found a group of people&mdash;principal, teachers, and
possibly truant officer&mdash;who are free from the personal
bias of the family and who have been in daily contact
with the child arraigned. This joining of forces with the
school was one of the great advances made by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in its
development of the parole system. A good school record
was a concrete argument in favor of the boy, while
truancy and loafing were nearly certain to go hand in
hand with any very serious misconduct. But in order
to be useful such records need to be as full as possible.
School attendance, for instance, is best reported by
giving the exact number of days absent and present.
Similarly, inquiry concerning his employment should include
the statement of his hours of work and the exact
periods of unemployment as far as this is possible.</p>

<p>The work record of the wage-earner corresponds in
importance to the school records of the younger boy.
This inquiry must be handled very carefully. The fact
of a boy’s delinquency, if brought directly to his employer’s
attention, may bear disproportionately hard
upon him. But often the mere recital of his work
history by his parents or by himself would reveal the
essential facts, such as the number of shifts in employment,
the speedy “throwing up” of his job, and the
long waits between work.</p>

<p>Parents, neighbors, school, and place of work&mdash;this
completes the list of sources from which, at the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
of our investigation, the court drew its information.
The start made with the schools had not been extended
to the social and charitable agencies of the neighborhood.
Yet the records of the relief societies often contained
in compact form, ready to hand, facts which
were vital to a full understanding of the case. In 41 of
the 95 parole cases which came under our observation,
the families had records in the offices of relief societies.
Some of the family histories extended back fifteen or
twenty years, but in none of these cases had the records
been consulted by the court.</p>

<p>The agencies which keep less systematic records and
yet come in close personal touch with handicapped
families&mdash;settlements and churches&mdash;are no less valuable
as sources of information. In one of the parole
cases, involving a rather serious charge of burglary, the
insufficient account of the home surroundings was supplemented
by the apology, “As the house in which the
family lived is tenanted entirely by Italians, very little
information could be obtained for or against the boy.”
Yet across the street was a settlement in which the boy’s
history was well known and which was well qualified
to sponsor plans for his improvement. No opportunity
was given it to advise commitment for this lad in preference
to the parole and suspension of sentence which
sent him back to the streets absolutely without supervision.
Thus the social worker who may have been
watching a hopeless situation drag on for years without
power to intervene may lose the chance to carry
out a plan for the child’s welfare, and the court may
fall back upon a hasty judgment in place of the social
worker’s well matured program. The decision which
may hang upon a slender thread of scanty information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
is one of no slight importance. It determines the
environment of the child for several years during one of
the most plastic periods of his life. The verdict of
the judge will determine whether these will be spent
either in his own home or in an institution.</p>

<p>The main test of any system which either assumes
the name or takes the place of probation is its effect
on the individual child. What is the consequence for
the boy? Does it improve or encourage him so that
he makes any effort in a new direction? This is a difficult
task to accomplish, and to measure results is
perhaps still more difficult. Yet a priori it is evident
that with a system of parole carried on as here described
permanent benefit for the individual will not
result. In studying the entire history of any boy, the
few months of parole seem such a minor influence
in comparison with the other forces constantly working
upon him, that it is impossible to assign any large share
in the final outcome to the effect of such casual oversight
as the court has given. Nor was insufficient supervision
from this source compensated for by the volunteer
probation. As far as we could discover, only 36 per
cent of the paroled children on our records had been
visited by volunteers. Yet this percentage was undoubtedly
higher than the percentage for all cases
brought into court, because we deliberately selected
more than a due proportion of our cases from among
those under volunteer probation.</p>

<p>We have traced as accurately as possible the outcome
of parole in our 95 cases.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> In 78 cases the boy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
was discharged or sentence was suspended when the
parole period ended; in 14 cases the boy was committed
to an institution during parole. There were
other cases in which the boy was either rearrested and
committed or rearrested and discharged after parole.
In fact, our records show that this was true of about
one-half of the boys. A considerable group, however,
did not return to court at all before the age of sixteen.
The fact that the boys of this latter group escaped being
arrested again does not justify us in concluding that
they were “reformed.” We therefore studied the later
histories of the 83 boys concerned in the 95 cases of
arrest and parole, to ascertain, as far as possible,
whether the outcome was poor or satisfactory. This
inquiry was conducted, and the results were considered,
on the basis of boys rather than of cases. Our judgment
was determined by each boy’s regularity at school
or work subsequent to his parole, by the accounts of his
parents as to whether he was “out from under them”
or doing well, and especially as to whether he had committed
any offense more serious than the mere prank,
which in most of the cases had led to the original arrest.
It appeared that of the boys rearrested almost all had
conduct records that amply justified their being again
brought into court. In less than one-third of the histories
studied was the recent record so satisfactory, or
the cause for complaint so slight, that reformation may
be said to have taken place. That the system had a
deterrent effect on some of the boys is undoubtedly
true, but that it accounted for any real reformation is
not very probable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<h3>IV. THE BOY THAT GETS “SENT UP”</h3>

<p>The theory of commitment is in itself a matter for
serious consideration. It involves an attempt by the
state to undo in a new environment the evil results of
old environmental and home influences. In other
words, the law decides that the family life has
broken down for the time being and that others shall
undertake to do what the parents have failed to accomplish.
This is a grave step, presupposing a crisis and
justifying itself only through absolute necessity and the
actual achievement of its purpose.</p>

<p>The first question to be asked concerning any sentence
of commitment is, was no better alternative possible?
The preceding discussion has shown that the
judge has been seriously hampered through lack of provision
for more adequate methods of treatment. He
could not obtain for the boy, who needed also guidance
and incentive as well as discipline, the careful oversight
which a well organized probation system would
have afforded.</p>

<p>The second question concerns the effectiveness of the
sentence. Has the boy himself been helped in the direction
of discipline and an ordered life, and has the neighborhood
been benefited by the removal of a lawless
spirit? These are the questions which we shall try to
answer concerning some of the boys “sent up.”</p>

<p>The emphasis put upon the neighborhood point of
view has excluded any critical examination of the institutions
to which the boys were committed or any statistical
inquiry into their results. As in the previous
chapters, the angle of vision was exclusively that of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
district. A certain group of the neighborhood boys had
been committed, and we tried to find out how the neighborhood
appraised this action and what its results had
been for the neighborhood and the boys concerned.
The methods of different institutions, whether sound
or otherwise, their successes and failures, did not concern
us in themselves, but only as they had influenced
the lives of our children and were reflected in the
attitude of our people.</p>

<p>The conclusions of this section are based on a study
of 99 commitments, meted out to 75 children, in 67
families. In this group were the boys who had the
longest and most serious delinquency histories, and it
was important that the account should be made as
complete as possible. Five different sources were consulted&mdash;the
court record of the trial, the report of the
investigating agent of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, the school records, the relief
society records, and statements from the family and
neighbors. None of these sources was complete in
itself. However, the outline of the boy’s delinquency
history, including trivial arrests and more serious escapades
for which no arrest had been made, was pieced
together as fully as possible. There is surely much
more, at least in the way of illuminating detail, that
cannot be known because it had been left unrecorded.
The meagerness of the information is a serious handicap
to the agencies which seek to reform the boy, and
to the judge who must pronounce sentence upon him.</p>

<p>There are several different institutions to which the
boys of this group had been committed from the children’s
court. The division of these cases falls largely
along religious lines. The Catholic Protectory receives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
all the children of Catholic parents, excepting the extreme
cases of delinquent girls, who are sent to the
House of the Good Shepherd. The children of Protestant
parents are sent, if they are truants merely, to the
New York and Brooklyn truant schools. In the more
serious cases of delinquency, the boys are sent to the
Juvenile Asylum and the girls to the House of Mercy.
There is one city institution, the House of Refuge,
which is nonsectarian and usually takes charge of the
most seriously delinquent boys.</p>

<p>In committing a boy to an institution, the judge was
obliged to be guided mainly by the culprit’s court
record. The number of the boy’s arrests had perhaps
mounted past all ignoring and he was “put away.”
On the other hand, he may have been caught in some
particularly striking offense, or his gang may have been
in need of a subduing example. In some of these cases
the judge meted out the drastic punishment even
where there had been only a single previous arrest.
He had, as we have seen, no facilities at hand for
having a thorough investigation made of the situation.</p>

<p>The absence of investigation was definitely traceable
in our group of committed cases. The records of
53 arrests were studied to discover whether the cases
had been remanded for investigation or not. Eleven,
or about one-fifth, of the 53 cases had been so remanded;
42, or four-fifths, had not been remanded. The significance
of the 42 cases lies in the fact that the decision
was given on the day of the first hearing. Therefore
it is certain that no new investigation was made, and
that the boys were removed from their homes at a time
when it was impossible for the court to have known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
what these homes were like.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> In these cases, it was
the home and the family rather than the boy which
were tried and judged without investigation. Moral
bankruptcy was declared without the necessary evidence
in hand. We may well doubt whether in the
cases of some of these boys there was not a better alternative
to the institution sentence.</p>

<p>Even when from the point of view of the court the
crisis has been reached, a thorough investigation will
often make the sentence more intelligent, and occasionally
reverse the decision for a commitment. Certain
cases that seem desperate at the hearing do not
prove hopeless when conditions are thoroughly understood,
and are sometimes capable of disentanglement
at home. Certainly every intelligent effort should be
made by the court before allowing the odium of commitment
to rest upon one of its charges.</p>

<p>There were three boys in the group of 53 in whose
cases commitment had been a serious error. The first
was a Jewish boy who had been caught pilfering with
a gang of thieves. At his school, where he was rated
as a well behaved and promising pupil, the teachers
declared that the act was foreign to his character. In
fact, the school refused to believe that the charge was
true. The boy was overwhelmed by his sentence. He
refused to return to his class, gave up his previous plans
of going to the high school, and settled down as an
assistant in a trade for which he had no aptitude. A
thorough knowledge of his home and school relations
would have shown the court the sufficiency of a lighter
sentence and would have left the boy his elasticity and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
ambition. A second lad, who came from a family of
very high morals, was arrested during the slack season
of his trade. His entire previous history from all
sources showed that the sentence was unnecessarily
severe. The third case was that of a boy who was in
the care of a Big Brother. During the temporary
absence of the latter from the city, the boy got into
trouble and was immediately “sent up” without waiting
until the Big Brother could be consulted. The boy
had had a brutalized childhood, but was being slowly
won back to confidence in his fellows, and the temporary
lapse should have been condoned. Commitment
took away practically all his chances, and all the
work of his Big Brother friend had gone for nothing.</p>

<p>But let us consider the boy whose case really cried
out for extreme discipline, and who was accordingly
“put away.” This drastic step ought to have formed
the climax of his delinquency history. The test of
commitment is whether it really pulls the boy up short
in his delinquency career. As a matter of fact we find
that it frequently did not. The boy who had several
arrests on his record tended to add another commitment
to his first.</p>

<p>The final criticism of the system lies in the fact that
the commitment was often only the beginning of further
trouble. This is illustrated by the history of two
brothers, John and Michael Moran. The Morans were
respectable Irish people who had lived in the district
for years. The careers of the two boys given below
were by no means in line with family precedents. The
mother was a decent, hardworking woman who had been
a widow for many years. The boys, as she said apathetically,
had “got out from under her” and conditions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
had been too much for them. More terrible pictures
of childhood than those given in these records
would be hard to find.</p>

<p>John’s court career was begun before he was ten
years old. A year later he was brought into court a
second time on a charge of theft. A few months afterward
a third arrest sent him to the Catholic Protectory.
The commitment was a short-term one&mdash;thirty
days&mdash;and obviously had little effect. Six months later
he was brought into court a fourth time and in this case
he was paroled. One month later there was a fifth
arrest, and although his parole had not yet expired, his
case was neither investigated nor his parole revoked,
but he was simply discharged. Three months afterward
a sixth arrest sent him to the Protectory for a
second term.</p>

<p>Michael, his brother, had had three different sentences
to the same institution, where he had in fact
spent a great part of his short life. His first arrest was
for the theft of a pair of shoes. He was committed to
the Protectory for ten months. Three months after
he had been set at liberty he was recommitted for over
a year, this time for stone throwing. A year and a half
intervened,&mdash;only one arrest during that time, though
that was on the serious charge of burglary&mdash;and then
he was once more sentenced to the Catholic Protectory
for a year and a half. The charge was truancy. Four
months after his discharge he was arrested again, and
a year after he had been discharged from his third term
he was back in an institution. In this last arrest his
mother testified “that he wouldn’t work at all, and
might just as well be put away.” There was a touch
of humor in the fact that he expressed a preference for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
some other institution, because “he had been in the
College three times already.” He was sent to the
truant school.</p>

<p>One of the most important elements in the problem
is the attitude of parents toward the commitment of a
child. Perhaps most of them resent it and look upon
it as a misfortune and a disgrace. The very fact of
commitment is denied if possible; the boy is “in the
country,” or he is “visiting relatives.” The parents
are anxious to have him home again as soon as the
term is up or an application will be accepted.</p>

<p>Another group of families take a commitment with
the same indifference with which they accept all the
other unavoidable facts of life. If babies die, or the
husband is out of work, or the children are sent away
for a couple of years, it is all a part and parcel of the
inevitable, all equally removed from choice and regret.
Often the parents are so busy earning a meager living
that they hardly know where the children are passing
their time, and so the boys develop into rowdies who
spend their nights on roofs or stairs and their days in
loafing. Victims of drunkenness, need, and sickness,
they do not know the meaning of discipline, and it rarely
occurs to their families that they can do anything
in the matter, much less that they ought to.</p>

<p>More rarely the judge has to deal with a parent who
sees in the court the child’s best chance of improvement.
This happens chiefly in cases where the father
or mother is at work away from home, and cannot be
personally responsible for the children’s attendance at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
school. The father of one of our boys, for instance, was
a skilled English waiter, whose wife had died some years
before. His oldest daughter kept house, but the two
younger boys were beyond her control. The father
recognized the danger of their becoming increasingly
delinquent through his absence and the influence of
the neighborhood, and therefore allowed them to be
placed in the truant school as a safeguard.</p>

<p>Indeed, a large part of the trouble with the children
comes from the impossibility of proper supervision by
the parents. The absence of the father or mother is a
prolific cause of delinquency. The women say, “He
was all right until his father died”; or, “I can’t do
nothin’ with him since my man’s sick”; or, “Since my
husband went to all-night work in the slaughter house,
Jimmy and Tommy are always out late”; or, “I go
out to scrubbin’ at five o’clock in the mornin’ and
there’s nobody to give the children breakfast and chase
them to school.” In other instances, the prospect of
the long summer’s vacation spent idling on the streets
makes the mother uneasy, and she asks the judge to
“put him away until school begins to keep him off the
streets.” At other times the parents grow discouraged
at the strain of gang influence as against family discipline
and tell the judge to send the boy up “as his last
chance to be decent.” They occasionally have masses
said for the improvement of the child under commitment
and hope great things from his return home,
sobered down by a year or two of routine life. In these
cases, the parents have given the problem the most
intelligent thought of which they are capable and have
concluded that the institution is a preferable alternative
to the home and the streets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Again, there is a group of families who use commitment
for their own purposes. They are usually very
poor and seek by this means to make provision for
children whom they are unable to support. In some
of these instances, the parents had made an effort to
have the boy committed as a dependent. Failing in
this, they had then brought him into court on
the charge that he was “ungovernable” and was “in
danger of becoming morally depraved.” In other
cases, the mother of a child who will not stir himself
to find a job, or will not hand over his pay envelope at
the end of the week, tells the judge to send him up, as
she “has only bad of him.” In all these cases, the
children have somehow or other proved a burden, and
the parents utilize the court to relieve themselves of a
responsibility which, for a time, they are unable to
meet. When these children come of age, or are sufficiently
disciplined to go to work, there is generally an
application for their release. The connection between
the lack of earning power and the commitment is an
obvious one.</p>

<p>But whatever attitude the different families took
toward the juvenile court, whether they were resentful,
or apathetic, or whether they co-operated with the
court or used it for their own purposes, it was certainly
true that the more intelligent and disinterested element
in the district was strongly against commitment.
Temporary improvement there may have been, but
little if any permanent help resulted.</p>

<p>Wherein, then, lay the weakness of the method of
commitment employed? First, let us examine the histories
of boys whose lives showed notable improvement
after the sentence. There were two such boys, in particular,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
who had been distinctly “bad” boys before
their sojourn in the institution.</p>

<p>Martin Donnelly was one of the “successful” institution
cases. His mother “lived out” as a cook, and
he stayed with an aunt and uncle who had no children
of their own. His aunt said he was “a merry little
grig” until about his eleventh year, when “he began to
know too much.” He began to smoke, play truant, fib,
and avoid his home. Entreaties or punishment merely
made matters worse, and the notices from school and
officers became numerous. Martin set his whole gang
as spies upon his aunt, stole out of the back door when
she had followed him to school, and generally so upset
the family that it was an actual relief to them when his
petty thieving finally landed him in the Protectory.
He stayed away for months, and returned much sobered
down. His aunt said that he hardly spoke aloud when
he first returned, and that he “went about so quiet”
whereas he used to “racket down the stairs as if the
house was afire.” Soon after his return events proved
his friend, for his mother remarried and settled in the
country. He was taken into a new environment and
given a steady job. Ten months later he was still
faithfully at work and proud of his weekly six-dollar
pay envelope. Further report said there was not a
gang of boys within a mile of him, and that he was
safely out of trouble. In this instance the commitment
made a break in the life with the gang, but it was left to
mere chance events to complete the break.</p>

<p>A still more exceptional case was that of Stephen
Waters. He had been involved in all kinds of trouble
and had a court record. At the age of thirteen he had
been arrested for burglary but had been allowed to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
free. A half year later he had quit school entirely and
had spent all his time on the streets. Arrested for theft
and committed to the Catholic Protectory, he had
escaped after three days and it was almost a year before
he returned to finish his sentence. In spite of all this,
Stephen was not really a vicious boy. He was merely
weak and feared a beating if he did not follow the gang.
Upon his discharge from the Protectory he decided to
change his life. He left his family, took a room on the
East Side, and obtained a regular job driving an express
wagon. At the time of our inquiry he had been steadily
at work for a year.</p>

<p>These two boys, then, were exceptional cases in which
commitment, combined with other circumstances, had
actually and radically accomplished its purpose. The
discipline of institutional life had been followed by a
total separation from old comrades and by steady work.
In both cases, fortunate circumstances combined with
the effects of commitment produced happy results.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the boys who return to the old
streets and the old gangs have not much chance for progressive
improvement. In the Doyle gang, for instance,
we had eleven boys who had all been serious
delinquents and who had been committed to institutions,
some of them many times over. It is true that
several of these terms had been short, determinate ones,
but every one of these boys had had a longer commitment
also. The leader of the Doyle gang came from
an entirely respectable family. The father, a steady
and reliable man, had set a very fair example of conduct
to the boys. But Mrs. Doyle was a “slack”
mother at home and shielded her boys continually from
any discipline from outside, including the school. Proceeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
on the principle that “there has to be a black
sheep in every family,” she had achieved the distinction
of being the mother of five of the “wildest” boys in the
neighborhood. All five of the Doyle boys were enrolled
in “tough” gangs, and even the two youngest were
bad influences in the neighborhood. Even six-year-old
Dennis one day opened the school door, and, with all
his childish strength, hurled a stone into the hall full
of children. All of these boys had a sophisticated air
and a certain hard look of withdrawal when in the
presence of teachers or strangers, or, indeed, of anybody
outside the gang.</p>

<p>Raymond Doyle, the oldest of the brothers, was sixteen.
He was described by the principal of the school
as “having energy enough to supply ten boys.” He
made cat’s-paws of those that were weaker than he,
and domineered over even the stronger spirits of his
gang. In fact, he had been one of the very worst
influences, and responsible for a great many lawless
happenings in the street.</p>

<p>In May, 1906, he was arrested for robbing a grocery
store, but there was no complaint and he was discharged.
Later on in the same year he was arrested
on some unknown charge, and fined $5.00. At this time
his continual truancy became too serious to be ignored
and he was committed to the New York Truant School.
Mrs. Doyle resented this action and immediately transferred
the other children from the public school to the
parochial school.</p>

<p>Raymond was released from the truant school in
1907, but was not long out of trouble. He was in company
with John Larrabie and the two Rafferty boys
when Larrabie threw a brick and killed an organ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
grinder. He escaped arrest for his complicity in this
affair, but six months later he was again in court, this
time on a charge of burglary. Together with two other
boys, he had broken a pane of glass in a stationery store
and had run away with some fishing tackle and two
baseballs. The boys were put on parole and later the
sentence was suspended for all three.</p>

<p>In the fall of the same year, Raymond conceived a
bold plan for outwitting the truant officer. He persuaded
George Riley to join him, and together they
arranged a home on one of the tenement roofs. Here
they lived for three months, stealing enough food for
their needs or money to buy it and going down to the
streets only when necessary. One day in January,
when life must have been growing chilly out of doors,
George Riley was caught stealing a dozen eggs. He
was taken down to court, and sent to the Protectory
on his former record. Raymond was clever enough to
escape without even an arrest. A year and a half after
this episode, in August, 1909, Raymond was again in
court, this time on a charge of petty larceny. He was
discharged. Four months later he was involved with
his brother Patrick and another boy in a very serious
burglary and re-committed to an institution.</p>

<p>Patrick Doyle, his brother, had also had a grave delinquency
history. It is true that Patrick was not considered
an instinctively wayward child and might have
been influenced for better at the proper time and by
the use of wise methods. But under his brother’s unchecked
leadership his mischievous tendencies had led
him into lawless ways, and the court’s way of dealing
with him did not prove reformative. At the age of
nine he was brought into the public school by the truant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
officer, but the next day he ran out during the session
and did not return. Toward the end of that year, 1908,
he was arrested for stealing bread from a wagon. Three
months later he was caught with Matthew Rooney in
the burglary of a grocery store, and paroled for two
months. After one month of this parole had expired
he was caught again in another burglary and committed
to the Catholic Protectory for three months on account
of having violated his parole. Six months after he had
been discharged from this commitment he and his
brother Raymond, and a third member of their gang
were caught stealing in an apartment&mdash;the serious case
mentioned above&mdash;and all three were sent away for
long terms.</p>

<p>The circumstances of this burglary were secured from
various sources&mdash;the court records, the newspapers,
the school, and neighborhood gossip&mdash;all of the accounts
tallying in an unusually neat and accurate way.
Raymond and Patrick Doyle took Charlie Muller in
tow and broke into a neighbor’s apartment in search
of anything that could be readily converted into money.
They found a trunk standing in a corner and turned
the contents upside down upon the floor. From the
pile they selected a few articles of underwear and a
watch. They took a gun that was lying on a chair
and snatched up a canary bird in its cage. As they
turned to go, they were confronted by the older son
of the family, who had returned from work and was
standing in the doorway. One of the boys, this young
man declared, “pulled a knife for him,” so that he “ran
for his life.” On the corner of the street he found a
policeman, who took his address and promised to send
a detective. Meanwhile the boys came out of his house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
and went to a restaurant, where they were subsequently
taken in charge by the detective. The judge sentenced
two of the boys to the House of Refuge and one
to the Protectory, each for fifteen months. Raymond,
after his discharge, refused to work and spent his time
loafing at his usual “hang-outs.”</p>

<p>The attitude of the neighbor whose apartment had
been entered was significant. The older son, Samuel,
who had arrived at the climax and intercepted the
gang, was very vindictive. He appeared in the children’s
court as complainant and did all in his power to
secure the three convictions. On the other hand, Samuel’s
brother and sister wished to hush the matter up
or, at least, to keep it out of court. “All boys will be
wild and these are little things and mean nothing.
They just wanted nickels for moving pictures.” Reasoning
in this way, according to the easy-going standards
of the neighborhood, they tried to dissuade
Samuel from going to court and appearing against the
boys.</p>

<p>Charles Muller, who was sent to the House of Refuge
with Patrick Doyle, came from a respectable home.
His father had been dead for many years and the family
income consisted of the wages of his mother and older
sisters. Before the girls had become old enough to earn
the family had passed through a period of the direst
poverty. Charlie was not an ungovernable lad. On
the contrary, he had a weak and sullen disposition and
was often used as a tool by his comrades. His first
arrest was for playing craps in the street, and he was
put on what his mother called “patrole.” A son-in-law
went down to court and “paid $5.00 to a red-headed
lawyer fellow who said he could get him off, and did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
so.” Some time later he stayed away from school for
seven weeks without his family’s knowledge, always
coming in regularly at lunch time and pretending to go
back to classes. At this time his mother had a stroke
of paralysis, and he took advantage of her lameness to
disregard the previous rules about bedtime, meals, and
so on. He was arrested again, and this time it was
the daughter who paid the lawyer $5.00. In the
last arrest, for the apartment burglary, the family
refused to re-engage this man, and, according to Mrs.
Muller’s vehement declaration, “every boy in court that
day was sent away for fifteen months, Charles among
the rest.”</p>

<p>Joseph McGratty was another of the Doyle gang who
was first arrested at the age of nine. The McGratty
family was supported by the father, who was a street-cleaner,
and by an older son who was a jockey.
Joseph’s irregularities began with truancy and his first
arrest was for petty larceny. On this occasion he was
discharged. Shortly afterward he applied for a transfer
from his school on the ground that his family were
moving to a certain address in West Twenty-sixth
Street. The story of the moving was entirely untrue,
and Joseph never presented his transfer at any other
school. The school has since learned that the McGrattys
were still living at their old address, but it has
never been able to lay hands upon Joseph by any
means in its power and force him to attend. He has
been arrested for stone throwing, for theft, for larceny
of an automatic clock in company with the notorious
Rafferty boys, and twice for burglary, the first time in
company with the brother of the gang leader. His last
arrest sent him to the Catholic Protectory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>John Larrabie, who killed an organ grinder, was no
worse than several of his gang. His family was degraded
and desperately poor. The father drank and
the mother was given to loud-voiced harangues and to
calling maledictions down upon neighbors who displeased
her. John came to school ugly-tempered and
resentful. At a rebuke from his teacher he attempted
to jump out of the window. One day as he stood on a
roof with Raymond Doyle and the two Rafferty boys,
the quartette spied in the street below a couple of
Italian organ grinders with whom they were carrying
on a feud. Loose bricks were at hand for missiles and
in an instant John Larrabie had thrown one at the
“ginnies.” The boys saw one of the men drop in the
street&mdash;the victim died, in fact, only a few minutes
later&mdash;and two of them escaped across the roofs. The
other two, Larrabie and Joe Rafferty, were caught and
taken to court on a charge of felonious assault. They
were remanded for four days and then discharged to the
coroner. The court records show that John Larrabie
was rearrested at the coroner’s for manslaughter, that
his guilt was patent, but that no complaint was taken.
Four months later he was committed to the Catholic
Protectory, at his father’s instance, as an ungovernable
child, his father being ordered to pay $2.00 a week
toward his support in the institution.</p>

<p>The brothers Riemer, Henry and Alexander, were
two of the “wildest” boys of this gang. Both were
incorrigible truants. They were arrested in November,
1906, for stealing coal from a neighbor’s cellar and
were paroled. In February, 1907, Alexander was sent
to the Protectory for three months for stealing a chicken
from the Washington Market. Four months after his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
discharge he was re-committed for nearly a year’s term.
Shortly after this, in April, 1909, he was arrested for
stone throwing, fined $1.00, and imprisoned one day.
In November he was arrested for assaulting another
boy. As he had been away from home four days, and
from school a week, and had been involved in the theft
of a pair of gloves, and also because his mother recommended
commitment, he was sent to the Protectory for
a third term. He was not discharged until of working
age, when the family secured him a job directly under
his father’s supervision. Henry Riemer was arrested
several times with his brother, and also twice for theft,
once for striking a boy over the head with a pistol, and
once for injuring property. He saved himself from a
commitment in one affair, a glove robbery, by informing
on Harry Rafferty and sending the latter to the
Protectory on his evidence. He himself had had two
terms there, and was still under commitment up to date.</p>

<p>The report of this extraordinary gang can fitly be
ended by a description of two of its most conspicuous
members, Joe and Harry Rafferty. Their home was
the scene of continuous brawling. The floors were
littered with broken crockery, with ham bones, and
glass&mdash;with anything that could be used as missiles.
The father and mother were drunkards, although both
had taken the pledge at times to obtain charitable
relief. After the father’s death from typhoid the conditions
grew still more serious. Joe “beat up” his
mother cruelly whenever there had been beer in the
house, and Mrs. Rafferty at last deserted her family
for several months in order to go and live on a sympathetic
neighbor, leaving the small children to shift for
themselves. When she returned home it was to bring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
back a “boarder” with whom she lived in immoral
relations.</p>

<p>The records of the Rafferty boys were, of course,
very bad. Joe was taken to the court with John Larrabie
at the time of the killing of the Italian organ
grinder. The neighborhood reported that Joe, who
was over sixteen, “saved his own skin by turning
state’s evidence.” The fact that there was no record
of Joe Rafferty in the court history of the case does not
necessarily contradict this statement. Certain it is
that he was credited with having “snitched” by the
neighborhood and also by the rest of his gang. The
boy fully believed that the latter intended to “do him
up” and that his only chance for safety was to leave
the city.</p>

<p>Harry Rafferty’s teacher described him as “a little
dock rat who is usually dressed in rags and with the
skin of his face half torn off because of his many fights.”
He had always been a bad truant. In 1908 he was
arrested twice, once for stealing boards from a wagon,
and once for stealing two loaves of bread. In April,
1909, he and Matthew Rooney, mentioned above as
an associate of Patrick Doyle in thieving, ran off with
a clock stolen out of a waiting automobile. Harry was
committed to the Catholic Protectory for three months.
In July he was discharged, and in November he was recommitted
for stealing a pair of gloves with Henry and
Alexander Riemer. This second commitment was also
for a short term, and soon after his release he was once
more in court on a minor charge. In October he was
sent to the Protectory for his third term.</p>

<p>In the face of these facts it was astonishing to find
that these boys were not completely ruined; that, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
there was something distinctly worth while in
both Joe and Harry. Of course, their records were very
bad, and both were growing less sensitive to moral control
with the years. But Joe had an instinct of family
loyalty and had struggled hard to keep his brothers and
sisters together. He had visited and written them
when they were sent away to institutions, and had
turned up promptly to take charge of them on the day
of their release. This affection and protective instinct
had been his only anchor, and the necessary breaking
up of the family, consequent on the mother’s immorality,
had promised to deprive him of his last motive
to reform.</p>

<p>The Rafferty family was one in which vice, drunkenness,
and squalor had combined to misshape the lives
of the children. The law should have proved the salvation
of the good qualities that in some miraculous
way still existed in that atmosphere. It is obvious,
however, that the law’s method in such extreme cases&mdash;the
frequent commitment&mdash;had failed to change the
conduct of these boys and to accomplish any reformation
in their lives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Commitment ought to induce a radical alteration of
life. But in many of our cases the commitments merely
proved interludes in wrongdoing. Even a temporary
improvement after discharge was not met with; the
dates of the subsequent offenses followed closely upon
liberation. In the face of such records a comparatively
short commitment, followed by the return of the boy
to the same neighborhood without any official supervision
and guidance, seems futile indeed. The histories
recorded here indicate clearly that with few exceptions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
neither boy nor family nor community had been benefited
by the action of the court.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that this district is exceptionally
lawless and gang-ridden and that the gang which we
have described was one of the worst in the whole neighborhood.
But what is here presented is not a study of
average results of commitments in average cases. Such
a study would have necessitated establishing close co-operation
with the institutions, in order to follow up
those children who had not returned to their old environment
at all after commitment, but had been placed
out in employment, or adopted into new homes. It is
from among these children that the institutions claim
the greatest number of their successes, and it would have
been necessary to include them if a presentation of the
whole problem had been attempted.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since commitment is conceded to
be an extreme method of dealing with extreme situations,
our examination and our conclusions seem all the
more pertinent. To examine the results in the most
extreme cases seems to be a perfectly fair way of testing
the working of the system. If a method particularly
planned for helping the worst cases of delinquency does
not help them, we must question the use of the method
in these cases, at least, and ask what we should substitute
for it.</p>

<h3>V. SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Reviewing our study of the three groups of boys described
in the preceding sections&mdash;the boy who is let
go, the boy who is paroled in the custody of his parents,
and the boy that gets sent up&mdash;we find that the impression
made by the court was rarely a permanent one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
One after the other we have seen how the typical boy
of each group passes through the hands of the court
and returns to his West Side environment scarcely
changed by his experience. For the boy who is let go,
it means but a ripple in his life. The court again goes
further and “paroles” him. At the end, he is still the
same boy. The most drastic treatment of all, commitment
to an institution for a definite short term usually
fails to remake the character of a boy who has been subjected
both before and after his sojourn in the institution
to the full force of the neighborhood influences.
When a boy is so difficult to manage that commitment
becomes the only adequate remedy, the term should be
indefinite so that release may depend on education,
behavior and development of character. And release
should be followed by supervision by a representative
of the court or of the institution until the boy shows
that he can stand morally without such assistance.</p>

<p>A well organized official probation staff without doubt
furnishes the most effective method for dealing with
most of these cases. This applies to all three classes
described in the preceding sections&mdash;the boy who is let
go, the boy who is paroled in the custody of his parents,
and the boy that gets sent up. The use of official probation
does not necessarily exclude volunteer probation,
but it should make possible careful supervision and co-ordination
of volunteer work under the court.</p>

<p>Our study points out the necessity of recognizing both
the family unit and the neighborhood unit in handling
cases. In order to do efficient probation work, the investigator
must be familiar with local conditions. He
needs to know, on the one hand, all the influences which
have helped to make the boy what he is, and, on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
other hand, the neighborhood agencies which are familiar
with his individual and family history, and may
be enlisted in reforming him.</p>

<p>A thorough physical and mental examination is necessary
in many cases before the court can proceed intelligently
in its treatment.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> A fundamental need also
in the treatment of juvenile delinquency is the conferring
of equity powers on the court, in order to
avoid the hindrances of purely criminal trials and to
reach the child and his family more directly.</p>

<p>Finally, we must not forget, in considering the darker
aspects of the extreme cases presented in the section on
commitments, that all delinquent boys are not of that
type. As a rule, the boy delinquent stands out among
the ranks of mishandled West Side youngsters only as
one of them who has had the misfortune to be apprehended
where others equally guilty have escaped; in
most cases he does not differ in any great degree from
his mates. Viewed from the standpoint of the district
and in the light of what we know of its manner of life,
juvenile delinquency is seen to be largely the product
of conditions dangerous to youth in the homes and on
the streets. To deal with the boy only after he has committed
a crime is to deal with the product and not at
all with the source of his offending; to allow him to
return to his old surroundings without official supervision
and control is, except in rare instances, a futile
expedient.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="large">THE CENTER OF THE PROBLEM</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> studying the boy of the Middle West Side we are
studying the future as well as the present of his
district; and in gathering together for a composite
picture his various traits which have already been noted,
it will not be out of place to refer once more to certain
neighborhood characteristics which he reflects as well
as to some aspects of his life and environment which
have not as yet been illustrated. In this volume we
wish mainly to present the boy as he is today, not to
suggest the method of his regeneration. But an attempt
to account for his peculiarities naturally results
in deductions which may seem to argue a basis for some
definite plan of reform; and with an increasing intimacy
with West Side conditions it becomes more and more
difficult to resist the conclusion that many of his vices
are forced upon him by circumstances so strong as to
be almost unavoidable.</p>

<p>Stealing, for instance, the theft of anything, but especially
of coal and wood, is, as we have seen, encouraged;
it is looked upon absolutely as a matter of course.
The boy is brought up to consider it part of the daily
routine;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> the winter cold drives home his family’s need
for heat, yet the family income is too slender to allow
the purchase of coal. His mother sends him out to get
fuel, and he knows that somehow he must find it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
line of least resistance is worn smooth in his neighborhood,
and it is natural and easy to fall in with the parental
fiction that the fuel which reaches the tenement
has miraculously dropped from heaven.</p>

<p>This fiction does not apply, however, to the more
general “swipin’” or “crookin’” which consists in stealing
on the spur of the moment any unconsidered trifles
which may be lying around. Usually things so stolen
are small and of little value. Boys start out on
“crookin’” expeditions, taking anything edible or
vendible that they can lay hands on; and in this they
have the example of older fellows, even married men,
who will steal in a desultory way whenever they have
the chance. “Every time I get a vacant house,” said a
wrathful real estate agent one day, “it means that I’ve
got to put in new lead pipes, or new faucets, or new
gas fixtures, or perhaps all of them. The damned crooks
of the neighborhood, young and old, break in and rip
them out to sell.” And a certain settlement had the
same experience. When it was first opened practically
every removable thing in the house disappeared, including
even the necessaries for meals.</p>

<p>Here again, though such thefts are far less excusable,
the boys have a definite point of view. They are quite
non-moral and have never learned to consider the question
of property. Their code is the primitive code of
might and they look upon their booty as theirs by right
of conquest. Further, the very pressure of poverty is
an incentive to stealing for various ends. They are
cigarette fiends&mdash;they must have cigarettes. They
are hungry; they crave amusement, and “the movin’
pictures” mean a nickel. All these things cost money,
and when one is penniless and knows no moral code and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
sees one’s elders acknowledging none, the temptation to
adopt the tactics of the thief and the thug becomes
almost irresistible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img id="i_189b" src="images/i_189b.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Closed by the Gangs</span></p></div>

<p>Much that these boys think and do is the direct result
of their natural propensity to imitate, combined with the
fact that they have never been taught the difference
between childhood and manhood. Thus they learn to
fight, to smoke, to drink as their elders do. Fist fights
in the street are of the most common occurrence,
particularly among the young men from sixteen to
twenty years of age. To “go down to the docks and
fight it out” is one method of settling all disputes,
whether of politics, love, or personal appearance.
Homeric tales are related of some of these combats.
A youth of eighteen demands of a bigger man an apology
for an alleged insult to the former’s sister. The two go
behind a sandpile on the docks, where in the presence
of a large group of witnesses they fight fiercely for several
hours until both are exhausted. Gang fights, as we have
said, are frequently settled by a personal fight between
two leaders. These fights sometimes end in one or both
of the combatants being maimed, and, with the rougher
element, occasionally in murder.</p>

<p>The seriousness of a fight between older men in this
neighborhood is recognized, and ordinarily every effort
is made to separate the fighters before they become
committed to fight to the finish. If a man is defeated
by the fists of his opponent, he will seize a club, a bottle,
a paving stone, or a revolver, if he can get one, and continue
the fight with this advantage. Very frequently
a street fight between two men results in a feud which
will be carried on from day to day, until one or the other
is permanently disabled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Often these feuds result in the destruction of property,
which is here an accepted way of “getting even.”
Tenants who are evicted are not unlikely by way of
revenge to do as much damage as they can to the apartment
before leaving. If one club is at war with another,
it is expected that the stronger will invade the premises
of the weaker and smash up furniture and furnishings.
Revenge in this district is wreaked primarily upon person;
failing that, upon property. And this latter custom
has become so prevalent and so much developed that
much damage is done from pure maliciousness and from
wanton joy of breaking and destroying. “Scenery
Burned by Vandals” runs a recent newspaper headline.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Vandals destroyed three truckloads of scenery
stored last night on “The Farm,” in Twelfth Avenue
between Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth Streets....</p>

<p>Shortly after 11 o’clock last night the first truck
was set afire. The scenery was covered with canvas,
and when the firemen arrived it was a total wreck.
Three hours later the other two trucks were set afire.
The trucks also were burned, and the total loss was
estimated at $7,000.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such outrages are quite common. They are merely a
development of the method employed by West Side
toughs for “getting a come-back”; merely a warning of
the fact that the district owns to no law but the law of
the Texan or Corsican Vendetta. Does someone habitually
steal clothes from the wash-line? Then the husband
“lays for” him with a club. Does some man or boy
strike a boy on the street? The mother, or father, or
big brother goes down to “get even.” Fear and gang
ethics forbid the giving of information, and the whole
neighborhood is saturated with treachery and suspicion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p>With examples of this kind all around him, what
wonder that the boy fights often and recklessly; that he
turns naturally to violence; and that his combats, singly
or in gangs, make no demands on the spirit of fair
play?</p>

<p>With regard to smoking, the little West Sider’s indulgence
is entirely unrestrained. On the streets, with
his gang, and often in his home, he smokes incessantly
from about the time that he is six years old; though, of
course, to a stranger or a settlement worker he will
deny that he has ever touched a cigarette. A boy’s
club in the neighborhood recently insisted that its
members be allowed to smoke during club meetings.
All of them said that they smoked at home and with
their parents’ full knowledge. These were boys ranging
from ten to fourteen years of age. In another club, a
boy of thirteen said that it was impossible for him to refrain
from smoking more than half an hour at a time
when he was out of school. Other boys sided with him,
saying that they simply had to smoke. By a vote of the
club, however, smoking was abolished during club meetings.
After that, this boy went to the roof or hallway
to smoke at intervals during the session of the club. His
was not an extreme case, although he smoked to greater
excess than most of the boys. And in another club,
which was formed away from settlement influence, it
was found practically impossible to keep the majority of
the boys from smoking. They were willing enough to
vote to abolish it, but were unable to adhere to the principle
which they themselves had established. A few
parents objected on principle to their boys’ smoking,
but they had not the power or opportunity of preventing
it. So the cigarette habit is added to the boy’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
vices, and the stunted, anemic cigarette fiend is a frequent
figure on these streets.</p>

<p>In the same way drinking and intoxication come quite
naturally into his life. Beer is a great dinner and
supper staple in the tenements, and every day sees a
long procession of women, girls, and boys, filing with tin
pails to the saloon for the evening drink. Most of the
girls make for the “Family Entrance,” though many go
unblushingly through the screen door to the main saloon
and come out a moment later with a foaming pail of
beer. Others,&mdash;and this is particularly characteristic
of the smaller girls,&mdash;ask some lounging male of their
acquaintance to go in and get the beer for them. The
deputy usually rewards himself by a long pull from the
pail before he comes out of the saloon. It is astonishing,
however, how large a number even of little girls and boys
ten years old or less, walk boldly out of the front door
with their pails. Almost every saloon has also its line
of ragged urchins, crouched on their hands and knees on
the stone doorstep, peering under the screen at the
crowd within. Occasionally, on gala Saturday nights, a
group of men will hold what is known as a “beer racket.”
Each one contributes a sum of money, fifty cents, a
dollar, or sometimes more, to a saloon keeper, who
agrees to furnish all the beer they can drink. The party
then retires to a convenient neighborhood roof, and
keg after keg is sent up until the last drinker has succumbed.
Usually one or more boys may be found with
the group, overcome with drink.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Favorite Playground</span></p>

<p>The beer pail is frequently refilled during the game</p></div>

<p>Little attention is paid by the neighborhood to drunkenness,
and among the boys themselves it is regarded as
rather a joke for one of their number to become intoxicated.
The worst feature of intemperance here is, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
not the occasional appearance of a boy intoxicated
but the indifference with which the adults treat such a
spectacle. At the last annual outing of the Tammany
leaders in this district a score or more of unaccompanied
boys, from ten to fourteen years old, managed by hook
or crook to join the excursion party, which counted
among its numbers many well known and responsible
business men of the neighborhood. From the time the
excursion boat left the landing to the time it discharged
its passengers, on both incoming and outgoing trips,
the excursionists were drenched in a torrent of free beer.
Kegs were tapped a dozen at a time, and in pails, in
glasses, in trayloads of “schooners,” it was rushed to the
upper decks so fast that it sometimes went a-begging
even among the hundreds of thirsty West Siders.
Naturally, the small boys got hold of it, and on the way
home a group of them with a gang of immature youths
scarcely beyond boyhood themselves, sequestered a
couple of kegs in a nook on the after spar deck and
actually emptied both kegs. When the boat landed
several of them plainly showed the effects of their
revel, and one boy of fourteen was helped ashore by his
laughing playmates, his legs reeling, his head rolling
from side to side, and his eyes staring with the dull
vacuity of drunkenness. Among the men, hundreds of
whom saw this sight, not a voice was raised in protest;
some laughed; some scolded the boys for their intemperance;
most watched with cynical indifference, as though
this were to be expected.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that all these vices&mdash;drinking, smoking,
ruffianism&mdash;come very naturally to the West Side boy.
Even if he realizes them for what they are, he is ill-fitted
to resist them. He sees them all around him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
from infancy; and, boylike, he makes them his own
through imitation.</p>

<p>Another of the many ways in which this versatile
youngster amuses himself is by playing truant.</p>

<p>The equipment of the typical boy of the Middle West
Side when he is first sent to school is pitiable. Excessive
cigarette smoking, the wrangling atmosphere of the
home, the excitement of the street, have sapped his
nervous power. He is restless, easily reduced to sulkiness,
and exceedingly hard to interest. The varied
excitement of the streets, combined with the inevitable
cigarette, has lost to him all power of continued thought
or concentration. School itself, like the boy, has little
chance. Perhaps it is lacking in anything which makes
a vital appeal to his nature, but from the first it is handicapped.
Not only is the lure of the streets tremendous,
but the bewildered school teacher is presented with a
child who has been born into ignorance and inexpansibility,
reared in an atmosphere of discord and vice,
and given every chance of acquiring disastrous physical
and moral habits, before ever he reached the class room;
and the problem that confronts the teacher is not that
of building up a character but of making over one that
is already seriously deformed.</p>

<p>The sources of the truancy habit are undoubtedly to
be traced in the boy’s first acquaintance as an infant
with the streets. As we have seen, he is familiar from
babyhood with the bustle and confusion of street life
and his first pleasurable experiences are associated with
it. The atmosphere of the street, its scenes and sounds,
permeate the child’s whole existence and fasten upon
him the shackles of habit. After a year or two of more
or less complete subjection of his budding mind to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
influence, the child is expected to exchange without
protest the thrilling, lawless streets for the orderly
commonplace of the school room. Of course he is
attracted by the novelty of the latter for a time, but
after that he feels the strain of two conflicting influences&mdash;the
lure of the street and the instinct of obedience
to authority. If he wishes to yield to the street,
he has the traditions of generations of truants and any
number of conniving playmates to aid him to escape.
And here we have the beginnings of the “delinquency”
which almost inevitably sooner or later leads him to the
juvenile court.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Here is the confession of a ten-year-old truant, which
is typical of school life in the district:</p>

<p>“I used to go to the Fifty-second Street school with
Jimmie, but they made me change to Forty-eighth
Street because I stayed away so much. I would leave
home in the morning at school time and then come up
here and play in the streets instead of going to school.
I would just hang around the corners with the other
boys or go after loot with them. A little while ago,
Jimmie and I wanted money, and we got a dog to follow
us into a candy store on Eleventh Avenue, and
there we tried to sell it. It was a dandy dog, a thoroughbred,
but the storekeeper said he had two already and
wouldn’t buy it. We tried to sell it again but it got
away from us. We tried that with another one once but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
it was a bum one. Nobody would buy it, and after
spending the whole morning trying, we gave it a kick
and chased it off. Jimmie and I and a bunch of boys all
got a duck apiece in Jersey once and we were able to sell
them for fifty cents apiece.”</p>

<p>“How do you get over to Jersey without paying?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” said Jimmie, “you go down to de
ferry and wait till two or t’ree ladies comes in togeder.
One of ’em gits two or t’ree tickets for the bunch, and
you step right up in front of the first lady, like you
was her son. The gateman sees the tickets in her hand,
and then you beat it, while she’s tryin’ to explain to the
gateman. Coming back is easier still, ’cos you can
always sneak through the wagon, or express, or employes’
entrances there.”</p>

<p>“When our whole family goes to Jersey,” went on the
narrator, “all of us kids sneak in that way. My father
buys tickets and then we walk through the gates and he
refuses to pay for us because he don’t know us. Just
now it is too cold to go to Jersey much, or do anything
but keep in school. Besides I’m on parole now. I have
to have a good conduct card and have to go and see
Mr. Carson once in so often and tell him about what
I’m doin’.”</p>

<p>Truancy here is developed into a system, which the
youngsters can adjust to any occasion with the greatest
facility. If you start to school with your books in the
morning it is an easy matter to leave them at a candy
store or with a friend, and put in the morning furthering
your own interests on the docks or in the streets.
If a truant officer asks you your name or your business
on the streets, one name is as good as another,&mdash;if it is
far enough from your own; and there are many plausible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
reasons for being out of school, if you can avoid having
to prove them. A placating note to your teacher written
by yourself is as good as one by your mother, if you can
only make the teacher believe that your mother wrote
it. After two or three days in the street, it is necessary
to maintain a strict watch over the mail box, if you
would beat your parents to the truant officer’s notice
which will sooner or later be found therein. This notice
can be removed from the box by the judicious use of a
bent pin, and communication between the school and
the home is thus indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>Once these details are arranged, the streets of New
York are open to the boys for a holiday. Money, while
not an absolute necessity, is much to be desired, and
there are many ways of obtaining it,&mdash;witness the statement
of “Jimmie’s” friend, above. It is against the
law for boys under fourteen years to work, and the
greater number of employers to whom they apply do
their best to make this law effective; in any case, labor
as a financial resource makes no strong appeal. But
there are things to sell if you can only get hold of them
without being caught. Pennies may be begged, or
stolen from other and smaller children. Similarly food
may be begged when necessary, or obtained unobtrusively
from fruit stand and grocery counters. Jimmie’s
friend is by no means the only boy who starts for school
regularly every morning and very often does not return
before nine or ten o’clock at night, staving off the pangs
of hunger (which often seems to be the only form of
homesickness known in this district) through the resources
here described.</p>

<p>Akin to truancy is the “wanderlust.” This passion
to get out and away, travel, and court adventure, comes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
to the boy of the Middle West Side as it comes to most
boys&mdash;and often he obeys its call. The resulting experiences
are usually only a short and amusing incident
in his life; very rarely do they lead to a permanent
change. One young adventurer told of a characteristic
trip:</p>

<p>“Denny Murphy came over to our house one morning
last summer and said, ‘Red, let’s beat it.’ ‘Sure,’ I
said, ‘where to?’ ‘Out west,’ Denny said. I did not
have anything else to do and I thought it would be a
good thing to go west. So that afternoon, Denny and
I went over to Jersey City. Denny had some money.
I don’t know where he got it, but he probably stole it,
for he was always crazy about robberies; talked about
‘pulling off’ robberies and things of that kind, and I
knew he had been in some hold-ups. We were going to
go to Philadelphia first, but I thought we needed more
money and could probably get a job in Paterson. So
we took a freight train to Paterson. Got there in the
evening and I tried for a job in the factory. I told the
man I had been getting six dollars a week in another
factory and told him I lived in Paterson, but the
manager caught me lying about where I lived and fired
me out. So Denny and I slept that night in the doorway
of that same factory.</p>

<p>“In the morning we both looked around for a job,
but there was nothing doing. Finally I got on a barge
and they were going to take me on there washing dishes
and being cabin boy, but there was nothing for Denny
to do, and the boat was going up the river instead of
down, so there wasn’t any use in our staying there; so
that night Denny came in and we slept on the back of
the boat. Denny had some more money now&mdash;No, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
don’t know where he got it&mdash;and we went over to Jersey
City again on the trolley car. Then we caught a freight
train for Philadelphia. The cars were locked and we
had to climb clear up and ride on top. We got down to
some town just the other side of Trenton before a
brakeman saw us and booted us off, and then we had to
wait there the rest of the afternoon and get on a coal
car which took us to Philadelphia. We spent that night
in a freight car and then got on another freight train
out in the West Philadelphia yards and started west.
We climbed in a box car marked ‘Springfield, Ohio,’
shut the door, and I went to sleep. When I woke up it
was daylight, and the car was in another city. I supposed
it was Springfield but it wasn’t; it was only Harrisburg.
We walked all around the town, but we couldn’t
find anything to do, and finally we got out of money.
Along about dark we saw a bellboy, we thought he was,
coming out of a hotel. He was a ‘coon’ in uniform, so
we thought he must be a bellboy. Then Denny said,
‘Here’s our chance to get money.’ He said we could
take a club and come up behind and blackjack the coon
and rob him. So we came up in the dark and just as we
got close up behind him, he turned around and we saw
that he was not a bellboy at all but a policeman. I
never knew before they had ‘coon’ policemen anywhere.</p>

<p>“Denny and I beat it for the railroad as fast as we
could go. We did not wait to eat or anything, but
caught a freight train that we saw moving, and when we
got on we found we were bound for Philadelphia again.
In the car with us was a ‘coon’ bumming like we were.
He wanted to know who we were and where we were
going. We told him we were just looking around the
country, and he wanted to take us south with him. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
said the Southern people were mighty fine people and
would surely give us good jobs if we would go with him
as far as Atlanta. We had come back from the west
now and we thought we might as well go south as anywhere
else, so we told him we would go with him. Then
I went to sleep again and when I woke up there wasn’t
any coon any more. He had beat it somewhere and left
Denny and me behind.</p>

<p>“We got off the train at a little station called Overbrook,
just outside of Philadelphia, and just as we hit
the cinders, two railroad detectives jumped out from
behind the switchhouse and grabbed us both and that
ended our western trip.</p>

<p>“They took us into the city to the House of Detention,
where we stayed over that night and the next two
or three days. There was a man there who treated us
fine and made us tell all about ourselves, and after two
or three days he put us on a passenger train and sent us
back to New York. I’ve never tried to go west since.”</p>

<p>Parties and dances, now and then a “grand annual
ball” or “fête” at a dance hall or casino, an occasional
visit to a moving picture show, one or two dilapidated
poolrooms, and the sordid and ever-present saloon&mdash;these
are practically the only amusements definitely
offered to the West Side boy. And as he casts about for
means to supplement them it is natural for him to turn
early to indulgence in sexual immorality, which he has
seen and heard talked of in the tenement and the street
since he began to be old enough to notice anything.
His sense of modesty has been strangled at birth. All
round him he is accustomed to hear obscene terms,
the meaning of which any older person will freely
explain in a way which robs them of any moral significance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
whatever. There are plenty of “big fellers”
and “wise girls” on the streets to teach him anything
that he wishes to know. In the tenements themselves
immoral practices are common even among small
children, with the full knowledge of everyone except
their parents, who are nevertheless apathetically aware
of the sins of their neighbors’ children. In a number of
ways the boys here learn, not the truth about reproduction,
for that is very little known here, but about sexual
enjoyment and its many forms of perversion, topics
which occupy a large share of the mind of adolescent
youth in this environment. Children of both sexes
indulge freely in conversation which is only carried on
secretly by adults in other walks of life. Certain roofs
in the neighborhood have a name as rendezvous for
children and young couples for immoral practices.</p>

<p>In common with other districts of the city the neighborhood
has many sexual perverts, and these furnish an
actual menace to the children. As infants, practically,
the boys have heard the same stories repeated until
they regard sexual matters as forbidden, of course,&mdash;and
therefore, like smoking cigarettes and gambling,
to be hidden from parents, police, or other authorities,&mdash;but
with no sense of abhorrence. Knowledge of the
methods of the perverts, on the other hand, leads to
experimentation among the boys, and to the many forms
of perversion which in the end make the degenerate.
Self-abuse is considered a common joke, and boys as
young as seven and eight actually practice sodomy.
Every night the doorways are blocked with girls from
fourteen to twenty years of age who lean against the
walls and rails, and talk with the young men, the “talk”
occasionally degenerating into a laughing scuffle. Girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
as a rule are never mentioned by the boys except in
club-room stories of the grossest immorality.</p>

<p>Universally these boys lack stamina&mdash;physical,
mental, moral. They are incapable of prolonged exertion;
a minute or two of fast boxing exhausts them
completely, and only the exceptional ones are able to
box continuously for more than two or three rounds.
Their baseball teams are too apt to “blow up” in the
fourth or fifth inning, no matter what individual cleverness
some of the members may have shown, because
the players are so shortwinded and feeble of limb. There
are, of course, a number of well developed athletes
among them, but a boy of normal physique stands out
far above his playmates, and those of exceptional skill
are few indeed.</p>

<p>Their mental energies are scattered and undependable.
They are incapable of prolonged thought upon any
one subject, and lack absolutely the concentration which
mental discipline can impart. Quick they may be and
clever, but they are seldom deep, and through years of
mental inaction they seem unable to grasp anything like
an abstract idea or principle. Of any except the simplest
and most exciting card games they quickly tire.</p>

<p>The lack of moral stamina is even more evident.
They are totally unable to resist physical temptation of
any sort. In fact, their training seems to offer them no
basis of resistance. They are accustomed to striving not
to overcome but to gratify every desire. Lack of privacy
and the hopelessly unmoral attitude of the neighborhood
toward all matters of sex have left them without any
moral standards. In deceit and treachery, the use of
superior force and of unfair advantage, they see nothing
to be avoided or ashamed of. Revenge and the fiercest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
retaliation for real or fancied injury, accidental or
otherwise, are part of their code. Their life is a struggle
for self-preservation, and they are naturally consummately
selfish; for the feelings of others they have not
the slightest thought. Calloused into unmorality they
are unconcernedly cruel, and such a thing as the killing
of some boy in a gang fight will be related in a perfectly
matter-of-fact manner. They have no respect for age
or authority.</p>

<p>Two types of boy are common in these streets, widely
dissimilar, but equally pathetic. The first is the boy
who wants to “make good,” but cannot shake off the
shackles of association and environment; the boy
“who’d make something of himself yet if given half a
show.” Since leaving school and going to work he has
perhaps gone through the process known as “steadying
down” and “getting sensible.” Between the years of
fourteen and seventeen there may have come a loosening
of the old gang ties, a change, and a reshaping. A later
period seems to come when after the excitements of his
adolescent years he may realize, as to the loafing and
depredations into which he has drifted, that “there’s
nothing in it.” Sometimes even a boy from a down-at-the-heels
and shiftless family makes a desperate effort
to pull up. But he lacks the tremendous energy to
struggle through the bad name he has gotten by his
own career and by identification as “one of that crew.”
His bitterness is natural. “Oh, I know&mdash;that is another
of those Fifty-third Street stories about Charlie Harris.
I’ve heard enough of them.” Such a boy is most susceptible
at this time to home and outside influence, and
if only the opportunity can be taken it will be not unlikely
to prove the turning point in his life. But too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
often there is no one at hand to help him. The West
Side boy does not always respond to kindness. He
knows little or nothing of it in his life, and his native
fickleness and dislike of direction make him, especially
after the school age, difficult to handle.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes the effort does succeed. George Ruhl,
for instance, was the oldest of three children in a poor
German family. Some years ago, when one of the
settlement workers first knew him, he was unruly and
“difficult” and quite beyond the control of his parents.
He refused to go to school, smoked cigarettes, and got
into bad company with his gang. When he was twelve
years old a settlement worker sent him away to the
home of the Salvation Army. The superintendent would
not keep him on account of his bad influence upon the
other boys. In order to remove him from his gang Miss
Summers had him sent to a Boys’ Republic. The leader
kept him for two years and gained a remarkably good
influence over the boy. He then placed George on a
farm in Massachusetts. George has turned out well.
The owner of the farm, a selectman of the town, treated
him like a member of his own family and trusted him
with money and other important matters. Finally he
rented a farm to George and another boy, and they are
prospering. They run a truck farm, raising also chickens,
eggs, and squabs. For many years George sent his
mother ten dollars a month to pay the rent. In 1909 he
offered to take the whole family down to his farm, but
Miss Summers advised against this because it would
have imposed too much of a burden upon the boy.
Here is a case in which outside help at the right time
worked wonders; and undoubtedly the same success
might result in many others, were there only more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
knowledge of the West Side and more voices that would
answer to the call. Meanwhile the boy “who can’t
make good” is still with us.</p>

<p>The second type commands pity but deserves few
excuses. It is the boy who refuses to make good. When a
boy goes to work even the lax discipline of the irregularly
attended school is absent. West Side boys are not
in demand, and his job is often that of an extra “hand,”
easily turned off, or else it is of a “blind alley” nature.
His delinquency, however, cannot be considered the
effect of his job, for boys of this type naturally seek for a
low grade of employment.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> In a fit of temper or idleness
he surrenders his job; perhaps he loses it unwillingly.
Whole days of enforced freedom will follow. One
day in the streets between weeks of monotonous hardship
in the factory may demoralize a boy. Possibly he
hears of another position, which he thinks will be easier
and pay more than the one he has. So he drops his
former job and takes the new one. Before he has been
in his new position long, the memory of his day of idleness
on the street overcomes him, and with a little
money in his pocket he quits his position, and this time
he does not hunt up a new one until all his money is
spent. The next logical step is to try to obtain food and
money as long as possible without working for it. And
so step by step has evolved the habitual loafer and hanger-on
of saloons, the young man who brags that he does
not earn a living and does not have to earn one. Two
boys known to our workers went through this process
and are now young men. Both live off the earnings of
mother and sister, and indeed, one of them ordered his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
sister to go to work “or else how could he live?” The
other blacked his sister’s eyes over a similar discussion.
Such things are common on the Middle West Side.</p>

<p>Both of these types are direct and logical products
of neighborhood conditions, just as many of the ways in
which the boy finds his recreation simply announce the
fact that he must invent for himself what his home fails
to provide. The boy’s inner life is bleak and wretched
because every normal instinct of youth, all the qualities
of which future men are made, have been sapped and
stunted by the gray, grim neighborhood in which even
play is crime. There are ten thousand hopeless little
tragedies on the Middle West Side today; and our only
answer to their appeal is to call for the police.</p>

<p>If the school is at a disadvantage in its labors to build
up character, the juvenile court is even more so. A
day at court is a transient experience and soon forgotten.
Even the effects of months of institutional life are soon
outlived under the strong influences of the street and
the gang.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our picture of the West Side boy is now wellnigh
complete. Lawless, defiant, a nuisance to his neighbors
and a menace to his playmates, it seems as though the
future citizen of these streets were little likely to become
other than a burden or a detriment to the whole body
politic. Certainly he and his gang, taking them as they
are, have little to recommend them or help them to
offset a notoriety which they have justly gained.</p>

<p>Of course, their days are not on this account all tears
and misery. That side of the story has been emphasized
because it bears upon the purpose of this study; but if it
were the only side these boys would be almost too impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
to be real. But they are very real, and very
boylike, careless and happy-go-lucky, too young to
know&mdash;of if they did know to reflect on&mdash;what might
have been, taking their world as it is, and ingeniously
determined to make the best of it and have a “good
time,” no matter at whose expense. They are quaint
little figures, with their rich street vocabulary, their
heartless and yet almost innocent paganism, their capacity
for achieving the dangerous in amusement though
they bump into every corner on the way. Look at the
gang ready for baseball; its members do not seem overwhelmed
by the burden of juvenile delinquency. Look
at the little group “playing hookey” under the dock;
fear of the truant officer seems to sit lightly on the
shoulders of these boys.</p>

<p>No, comedy is no stranger to the Middle West Side;
only it is Meredithian comedy and the laughter which it
provokes is thoughtful indeed. And it is assuredly true
that if you would see all that is most typical of the West
Side boy, if you would see him as expressing what in his
life he really is, you must turn your back on comedy and
gaze on the sadder picture. Look at the illustrations
and see the boy himself; then read the following sketch
as the caption under the portrait. It is printed verbatim
from the New York <i>Evening World</i> of April 10, 1911, and
for its truth to life it cannot be bettered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Johnnie Moran, twelve years old, ... was arraigned today
... in the Children’s Court.</p>

<p>The boy was taken in charge Saturday night by Detectives
Carter and Brown from headquarters, after he had watched his
father die of dropsy thirty-six hours previously; after he had
seen the body robbed by a playmate; after he himself had
taken “de old man’s” watch, and had then gone to play
in the street as if nothing out of the usual had occurred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>Johnnie is undersized. His chest is sunken and his shoulders
slope; his furtive little gray eyes are deep set under a bulging
brow, topped by a shock of hair of no particular color; his
small fingers are cigarette-stained, and his clothes look as if
their origin had been the ash barrel. Here is the story he told
an <i>Evening World</i> reporter, while swinging his thin legs unconcernedly
from a bench in the room above the Children’s Court,
where the little prisoners were waiting to be called for trial:</p>

<p>“Me old man was sick a week and three days. I didn’t
know what wuz the matter wid him, and he didn’t neither. He
just laid around and groaned and his legs swelled awful. His
name? He wuz named John, too, and he was a night watchman,
when he woiked, down to the dock at Thoity-seventh
Street. Yes, sir, he drinked some mostly before he went to
work in the evenin’. But it didn’t seem to bother him. No,
sir, he never treated me bad; hardly ever licked me.</p>

<p>“The old man never had nothing to eat, ’cept what I bringed
him the first day he wuz sick. Yes, sir, I went to school every
day. I wuz ’fraid the troont-off’cer’d git me. The old man
didn’t mind&mdash;he just stayed by himself. No, sir, nobody
come to see him, and he never told me to git nobody. After
school I’d play in the streets with the other fellows and I’d
git some buns and milk. I didn’t want much&mdash;wuzn’t
hungry&mdash;and the old man never seemed to want anything.”</p>

<p>Johnnie produced a wad of chewing gum from some recess
of his jacket and a second later the atmosphere around him
reeked with the odor of mint.</p>

<p>“Thursday night,” he went on, “he wuz took woise. I
slept on a bundle of old things in a corner and in the night I
heard the old man git up and go in the kitchen and sit down
there. He groaned somethin’ awful&mdash;like this,” and the boy
gave a startling imitation, “and I couldn’t sleep and I told him
to shut up. Then, after a while, he stopped groaning and when
I got up to go to school I see he wuz nearly all in.</p>

<p>“He told me to tie a rope around him and try and pull him
onto the bed and I did it, but it wuzn’t no use. Then I went
out and got a roll and a glass o’ milk and when I come back he
wuz half way onto the bed, and he didn’t answer when I spoke
to him and shook him. I called him four or five times, but he
never answered, and so I went on to school. I didn’t want the
troont-off’cer to git me.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I knowed he wuz dead, but I had to go to school.
Then after school was out, I told some of the fellers and two of
’em went up in the room with me, and one of ’em&mdash;he wuz a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
big boy&mdash;took five dollars out of the old man’s pocket and I
took his watch. The big boy&mdash;his name wuz Frank Reede&mdash;wouldn’t
give me none of the five dollars and he and the other
kid run away.</p>

<p>“The next day I got hungry and I told the janitor and he
told the cops and they come and got me and took the old man’s
watch to keep for me. Yes, sir, I’m sorry the old man’s dead.
He wuz good to me. No, sir, me muther is dead. She died
when I wuz a year old when we lived in Thoity-thoid Street.
I dunno how long we have been living in Thoity-seckin Street.
What’ll they do with me, Mister?”</p></blockquote>

<p>What shall we do with him? That is a question which
the institutions, the officials, and the people of New York
must answer.

<h2 id="REPORT_OF_CHILDRENS_COURT_1913">REPORT OF CHILDREN’S COURT, 1913<br />

<span class="smcap large">Excerpts from Annual Report Court of Special
Sessions of the City of New York</span><br />

<span class="medium">For the Year Ending December 31, 1913</span></h2>

<p>The following tables and charts are taken from the
annual report of the children’s court for the county of
New York.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this report the court officials
had the active co-operation of the Committee on Criminal
Courts of the Charity Organization Society. With
the approval of Frank Smith, the Chief Clerk of the
Court of Special Sessions, and under the direction of
Lawrence Veiller, Secretary of the Committee, the
report was planned and compiled by George Everson,
the Assistant Secretary of the Committee.</p>

<p>These statistics, based on a total of 9,019 cases and
representing the juvenile delinquency of the entire
county, make it possible for us to compare some of the
features of juvenile lawlessness on the Middle West
Side with corresponding conditions in the larger area.
To quote from the report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The total number of arraignments in the Court for the
year 1913 was 9,019. The statistical tables of this report are
based on this large number of cases. Any facts concerning
juvenile delinquency in these statistics should be of permanent
scientific value because of the fact of the large number
of cases involved.</p>

<p>“In the present report an effort has been made to put
before the public more detailed information, in the form of
statistical tables and charts, than has been done in previous
years. These tables, and their illustrative graphics, will
show to some extent the detail of the work of the Court and
will make available for popular use some of the information
which is carefully tabulated for each case that comes into
the Court during the year.</p>

<p>“Many pertinent and interesting facts concerning juvenile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
delinquency are available from the court records. Owing to
the limited time at the disposal of the clerical staff for the
compilation of statistics from the individual records of the
Court, we have heretofore been unable to get as much of
the information before the public as we should like to have
done. The assistance which we have received from the
Committee on Criminal Courts of the Charity Organization
Society has made it possible for us to put the statistics in
their present form, they having collaborated with our staff,
at the expenditure of considerable time and money, for which
we are considerably indebted.</p>

<p>“The installation of the probation system, with its very
accurate and detailed records of each case investigated by,
or placed in charge of probation officers, has put many more
facts at our disposal in regard to the family conditions, school
and employment records, etc., of children receiving probationary
treatment. It has been our purpose to include some
of these facts of general and scientific interest in this report.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Charts and Graphics.</span>&mdash;An effort has been made to
illustrate the most pertinent facts brought out in the statistical
tables by some simple charts and graphics; it is hoped
that the reader will get at a glance the gist of the tables so
illustrated. In some instances, the charts have been used to
supplement the information included in the tables accompanying
them.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Special Proceedings and Juvenile Delinquency Distinguished.</span>&mdash;It
will be noted that throughout the statistical
tables distinction has been made between cases of
children arraigned as juvenile delinquents and children
arraigned in special proceedings. An explanation of these
terms may help the reader. The general distinction, broadly
stated, is the same distinction which is generally made between
delinquent and dependent children. Special Proceedings,
however, include beside improper guardianship
cases, so-called, all cases of truancy, ungovernable and disorderly
children, and cases of girls in danger of becoming
morally depraved. While these latter are considered by the
Court as being in need of the care and protection of the
State, their offenses often show evidence of grave moral
turpitude, and the Court finds them to be among the most
difficult cases to handle.</p>

<p>“Whenever, in the case of a child brought before the Court
on the charge of juvenile delinquency, it shall appear in the
course of the trial that the child is without proper guardianship,
or is in unfavorable environment, he or she may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
adjudged to be in need of the care and protection of the
State, and is then arraigned in Special Proceedings.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Probation.</span>&mdash;Within the last two years great advances
have been made in probation in this Court. A complete and
well-organized system of probation records has been installed,
and the Court has the service of twenty-three probation
officers who devote their entire time and energy to the assistance
and reformation of children placed in their charge by
the Court. The results of their investigations are invaluable
to the judge in making his disposition of the cases, and their
work in helping the boys and girls to become good citizens
is a great service to the community. The only fault which
we have to find with the present system is the fact that the
period of probation in general is not long enough to allow
the probation officer to do his best work with the children
under his charge. Table XXX, and its accompanying chart,
shows the length of the probation periods; it will be noted
that one-quarter of the cases are on probation for a period
of two months or under, while 80 per cent of them are for
periods of less than six months. It is the opinion of experts
that proper probationary treatment can be given only when
the child is placed under the officer for sufficient length of
time to allow the officer to do really constructive work with
the child, so that it will be of lasting influence in his life. If
the offense is not sufficiently serious to require a substantial
probation period, then it is not of sufficient importance to
have the probation officer spend his time with the case. In
order to have longer probation periods a larger corps of probation
officers will be necessary.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Truancy.</span>&mdash;The report shows that there were 62 cases
of violation of the compulsory education law brought into
the Court during the year. Investigations of cases by the
probation officers have disclosed the appalling prevalence of
truancy among juvenile delinquents. Hundreds of cases are
on record in the probation rooms showing that children on
probation have been habitual truants previous to being
brought into the Court on delinquency charges.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the group of cases defined as Special Proceedings
is often found the neglected young girl of the accompanying
study by Ruth S. True. The columns in
the following tables dealing with girls’ cases will throw
some light on the charges on which she sometimes gets
into court.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> material for the following studies was collected
by four persons. The final chapter,
which deals with the Italian girl of the West
Side, was prepared by one of the group working independently.
This course was necessary, as the Italian
girl’s life is inseparable from that of her family and the
only approach to her is by way of her own home. One
could not know the Italian girl of the West Side without
knowing also her father, her mother, and her
numerous brothers and sisters, if not, indeed, a great
many of her relatives. The other three workers, including
the writer, joined in the management of a small
house which was used as a recreation center and club
house. They also collaborated in keeping a daily journal,
to which reference is made in the following pages.</p>

<p>It was our wish especially to gain some knowledge
of the type of girl who is seen so frequently at the street
corners and who refuses to be attracted to agencies
which frankly declare a desire to improve her. The
club, therefore, adopted an open-door policy and the
leaders tried to refrain from obvious attempts to influence
or control the girls who came. The aim was to
encourage sincerity among them, and to prevent their
“playing up” to superimposed standards “for what
there was in it.” Not that we thought that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a2">2</span>
girls were especially inclined to practice fraud; but we
knew from experience that work with too obvious a
purpose “to do good” often encourages hypocrisy.</p>

<p>One of our reasons for opening the Tenth Avenue
club for girls was that we had found it impossible to
be on an intimate footing with them in their homes.
The atmosphere of family life was far too often one of
mutual reproach and recrimination, and the visitor was
likely to find herself in the embarrassing position of a
court of appeals. Picture an evening spent in the company
of the two Katie Murphys, mother and daughter,
thus: Mrs. Murphy, sitting with folded arms in the
rocking-chair, rehearses the story of Katie’s sins.
Katie leans against the back of the sofa with dropped
eyelids and a face as expressionless as putty. All the
efforts of the involuntary court of appeals to induce
the girl to say a word in her own behalf are met by
stony silence. Meanwhile, the mother runs on, zealously
driving nails in her own coffin as far as the girl’s
affection and confidence are concerned. Harassed by
the problem of feeding, clothing, and housing six children
on $8.00 a week, Mrs. Murphy has little strength
or imagination left for the subtler problem of how to
handle an adolescent daughter.</p>

<p>It was such experiences that taught us the necessity
of providing some neutral ground on which to meet
Katie Murphy, if we were to secure her confidence.
This neutral ground took the form of club rooms
where we established ourselves with the definite intention
of giving Katie the just due of her youth,&mdash;a good
time.</p>

<p>We continued, however, to visit the families of girls
in the course of the investigation, collecting thereby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a3">3</span>
material for the observations on home life contained in
the following chapters. The girls themselves welcomed
our visits even though they must have realized in a
vague way that we were keeping “tab” on conditions
in the homes from which our club members came. One
day May Sipp,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> a new girl, came to one of the club
leaders and said, “Miss &mdash;&mdash;, will you come to my house
tomorrow?” The leader thought that perhaps a party
was being planned and asked for further details.
“Why, no one has been to my house yet and I’d like
to have you come,” the girl explained. It was evident
that she felt a little put out because her home had not
as yet been visited.</p>

<p>It was the middle of December when we first opened
for the girls in the neighborhood the house which we
had taken for the purpose. The place received no
more colorful name than the number on the door, “471,”
by which it was designated during the whole time we
occupied it. “471” was a red brick structure consisting
of three stories and a basement. It was rather a
friendly looking house with a “stoop” and the remnants
of front and back yards; that is, there was a small
area in front guarded by a low iron fence with a gate,
and a square box in the rear which became a “playground”
in summer. A supervisor from Christ Presbyterian
Church was placed in charge of the latter, and
the children crowded into the little box in such numbers
that we soon had complaints from the neighbors
against the shrill chorus rising from the back yard.</p>

<p>The front yard was of no particular use except that
the iron gate served to stimulate the imagination of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a4">4</span>
small boys who haunted our premises. It was a
continual bone of contention. It was always being
carried away by bands of enemies and heroically restored
by bands of friends&mdash;who were sometimes one
and the same&mdash;until at last we decided to remove it
entirely from the sidewalk, where it was of no earthly
use as a gate, and store it in an inner closet.</p>

<p>We occupied two floors of the house, the ground floor
and the basement. In the basement was a large, well
lighted kitchen and a living room. On the first floor
were two large connecting rooms which were furnished
with folding chairs and a piano. Though our equipment
was meager, we had a cook stove and a piano.
These two pieces of furniture we came to regard as the
necessary minimum of equipment for a girls’ club under
all circumstances.</p>

<p>The occupations of the clubs&mdash;cooking, sewing,
basket-weaving, brass work&mdash;were carried on as pastime
rather than as work. It was necessary to vary the
program repeatedly, for the shifting attention of the
girls refused to consider any occupation as pleasurable
for long at a time. The one thing of which they never
seemed to tire was dancing, and in spite of the ugly
forms which this recreation took, it had always the
beauty of spontaneity. Their fondness for popular
songs was almost as spontaneous. “The Garden of
Love,” “The Hypnotizing Man,” “When Broadway
was a Pasture,” “The Girl that Married Dad,” and
others of the same lurid and sentimental strain were
sung over and over to an unvarying appreciation.</p>

<p>Our relations with our co-tenants at “471” threw
much additional light on conditions of life on the West
Side. Above us on the second floor lived the McClusky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a5">5</span>
family. Ellen McClusky was fourteen, and since her
mother’s death two years before had been housekeeper
for her father and three brothers. Lately one of the
brothers had sickened of tuberculosis, thus adding to
Ellen’s housekeeping duties those of a sick nurse. Her
school attendance had suffered. The truant officer was
paying visits to the house and the health officer was
also knocking at the door. Thus the clouds had already
begun to gather on the McClusky horizon even before
our entrance on the scene. Ellen’s joy at the news
that a club for girls had moved in on the ground floor
of the house was unbounded. She was allowed at first
to come down to us every evening.</p>

<p>But Mr. McClusky soon turned against us. He was
a choleric individual, and was, moreover, constantly
agitated over the condition of his son, who was dying
by inches. It is not surprising that he turned violently
against the social coercion which demanded that Ellen
should go to school and his son be put away in a hospital.
He mishandled the truant officer and forbade
Ellen to have anything to do with the “teachers,”
whom he regarded as being in league with the forces
that harassed him.</p>

<p>Ellen would hang over the banisters in the evenings
watching the hall below. But her father had forbidden
her even to speak to us. In March the invalid brother
died, and the club rooms were closed for a week during
which the house was given over to the solemn splendors
of a funeral. After the undertaker had retired, the
health officer took possession and the rooms were submitted
to a thorough fumigation.</p>

<p>We opened our club once more, but Ellen was still
forbidden to come to us. She continued living in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a6">6</span>
isolation of the second floor, peeping over the banisters
in the evening. It was finally a great relief to our
overstrained sympathies when an officer of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, upon evidence
furnished by Ellen’s aunt, arrived and removed
her from her home. This ended the vicissitudes of the
McClusky family so far as we had any share in them.</p>

<p>On the top floor lived Mr. Distel, a German mechanic
about fifty years old. He was an odd little bitten-off
man, unkempt and kindly, who had lived alone in his
three little rooms many years. He liked to hear the
boys and girls downstairs, he said, and occasionally he
made clumsy efforts to join in, but he had been too
long a hermit. He could not. Needless to say, Mr.
Distel was our most sympathetic neighbor, and the
presence of the little man finishing off an industrious
and worthy life in his lonely top floor rooms made us
but the more determined in our task of supplying
wholesome good times to our friends.</p>

<p>The source from which most of our difficulties proceeded
was the spirit of disorder abroad in the neighborhood.
This was indeed a lawless spirit and, in its
extreme form, a sinister and menacing influence. The
“Gopher gang”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> figured largely in the neighborhood
gossip, and whatever may have been the actual extent
of Gopher operations in our vicinity, the current stories
about them, however inaccurate as to facts, were in
themselves a sufficiently evil influence in the lives of
the boys and girls of the district.</p>

<p>Our most direct contact with local disorderly influences
was through the gangs of small boys who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a7">7</span>
haunted our premises, demanding to be admitted. As
we were not prepared to open the house to them, our
apparent inhospitality drew upon us a series of attacks.
Not that all the attacks were acts of deliberate revenge;
they were sometimes merely outbursts of habitual
rowdyism. Nevertheless, they were a serious element
in our situation. We found that we could not run a
club for girls on Tenth Avenue without getting the
small boys’ consent. Time had to be spent in conciliating
them. At first our method was to station an out-post
on the sidewalk. To one of the “teachers,” who
proved an adept in gang psychology, this difficult task
was usually delegated. An entry in her diary under
the date of December 20&mdash;a date on which the usual
Tenth Avenue spirit was enhanced by the approach of
the Christmas holidays&mdash;reads as follows: “As it was
not my night on duty I had no intention of spending
the evening at the Tenth Avenue house. I stopped in
to speak to Miss Barclay and see how things were going,
but the disorder on the outside was so bad that I was
forced to spend most of the evening on the sidewalk
outside with the boys.”</p>

<p>An adventure which befell us on the second evening
after our “opening” might have had very serious results.
One of the club leaders was engaged in the front
basement room with a group of the older girls. Early
in the evening a gang of small boys gathered at the
window outside to upbraid their sisters for not letting
them come into the club. But they withdrew at a
word from the “teacher,” who might have suspected
such unusual docility, but did not. An hour later when
the girls were engaged in their club occupations, there
came crashing through the window a weapon seven feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a8">8</span>
in length, which proved to be a gun with a bayonet
attachment. It struck the chair in which the teacher
was sitting with such force as to chip the oaken back.
As the gun was slowly drawn into the room there was
much wringing of hands and a general desire to get a
“cop.” The gang had promptly made off, of course,
leaving the sidewalk deserted.</p>

<p>It became apparent that the small boy could do serious
damage unless conciliated. Treating with him in
the darkness of the sidewalk proved not to be successful.
It was evident that we must bring him inside and
examine him in the light. One evening just after the
front shutters had been pried open by depredators who
had then promptly run away, one of the club leaders
went out to the sidewalk, closing the door behind her.
Nobody was in sight. But she had only to continue
long enough in a motionless attitude to coax these young
animals from their holes. Presently a head came out
from behind a stoop, and another from an area opposite.
Soon several boys were edging along the pavement
toward the solitary figure in the dark, and in a few
minutes the whole gang had closed in a circle around
the trapper. She led them up the stoop, into the
brightly lighted sitting room, and called for a clear
statement of grievances. It was all ready. “Say,
ain’t no boys gona be let in never?”</p>

<p>The end of this council and of others which followed
was that we gave Saturday night to the boys. Gradually,
by this concession and others, we were able to
conciliate the gangs. The worst of our troubles were
over when they had been somewhat enlisted on our
side, but there were occasions when the alliance proved
embarrassing. For instance, one of the “teachers”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a9">9</span>
leaving the club late in the evening encountered a group
of the older boys who gallantly offered to escort her to
the car. As they neared the corner she remarked
hastily that she must catch a car which had just
stopped there. Before she could get her breath, four
of the boys rushed ahead, jumped on the front platform,
and began putting on the brakes so that the
motorman could not start his car. The astonished
club leader found herself seized by the other three
youths and hoisted upon the rear platform with a parting
shove which sent her hurtling into the car. The
hooting and confusion were intense, and the passengers
stood up in alarm. The boys, however, stood genially
waving their caps as the car started. When the conductor
came to collect the fare, he said suspiciously to
the new passenger, “Did you know them boys?” The
young woman was compelled to say that they were
friends of hers, to which he replied, “Gee, but you got
tough nuts for your friends!”</p>

<p>Stories of the disorder in the neighborhood came into
the house in many ways. For instance, it was vividly
reproduced in the conversation of the “gentleman
friends” of the girls, who were often our guests. This
was full of wild Gopher gossip and stories of arrests.
There was one evening in particular when Doran
thrilled us all with a long story of how he had gone
home early one night and was sitting reading his paper,
feeling rather queer&mdash;the trouble was in the air&mdash;when
a terrific noise broke out in the hall. A whole gang of
fellows had come into the house through the door on
the roof and gone plunging down the stairs pursued by
a trail of officers.</p>

<p>At this point in the story, Cleaver suggested that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a10">10</span>
Doran must have kept the door shut pretty tight, to
which he agreed. Cleaver then accused him of being
afraid, and recalled an instance when, as he claimed,
Doran had shut the door against him when the “cops”
were after him. Doran hotly denied this. The two
ruffled spirits had to be smoothed and then the talk
ran on, all about arrests and flights and pursuits. The
whole conversation indicated how precariously near the
edge of trouble these young men felt themselves to be
all the time. It showed also the kind of lawlessness
and rowdyism on which they built their youthful
ideals, which lead in turn to further acts of lawlessness
and rowdyism.</p>

<p>Echoes of the Gophers occurred in the talk of the
girls. At one of the first club meetings, a tall, attractive
girl arose and proposed as a name for the club, the
“Gopherettes.” As a motto, she suggested, “Hit one,
hit all.” This was Fanny Mayhew, who turned out
on nearer acquaintance to be a wonderfully cheerful
girl with a happy disposition and very popular with
her family and school teachers. Though perfectly able
to hold her own, she proved not so belligerent as the
episode had suggested. She told a club leader that she
had once belonged to a club of girls called the “Gopherettes.”
They had paid dues and even rented a basement
room for a short time. Later the club had moved
to the dock, and she had not been allowed by her mother
to go to its meetings.</p>

<p>It was unavoidable that the girls’ conduct should
reflect the character of their environment. However,
only once was there an outbreak against a club leader.
Among the friends of the house who kindly volunteered
from time to time to help with an evening’s entertainment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a11">11</span>
was a young woman from another city who had,
thanks to her own efforts and the interest of a wealthy
friend, raised herself from the ranks of the girls who
composed our clubs. On the occasion of this young
woman’s visit with us, there arose from the room where
she was engaged with a group of girls the sounds
of a violent quarrel. One of the regular leaders hastened
to the room, arriving just in time to prevent
blows. Julia O’Brien had lifted her arm to strike the
young woman who had come up from the ranks and
who was, moreover, for the moment the center of a
hostile, excited group.</p>

<p>The leader of the riot, led downstairs to the kitchen,
became instantly repentant, and the story of the quarrel
came out. One of the girls had stepped on Julia’s foot
and she had exclaimed, “Oh, hell!” It was an unfortunate
slip. Julia knew that swearing was not allowed
in the club rooms and she was making strenuous efforts,
as the leaders knew, to break a lifelong habit. But the
young woman from the ranks did not know this and
she had rebuked the guilty Julia in a tone of such cold
and stinging contempt that it had not only provoked
her victim to the point of striking blows but had drawn
upon the tactless leader the wrath of every girl present.</p>

<p>A subsequent talk with this young woman revealed
the attitude of offensive superiority which the girls
had so hotly resented&mdash;an unfortunate by-product
of her rapid rise into responsibility. A thoroughly
self-respecting and deserving person, she had the
peculiarly hard and unsympathetic attitude toward
those who had failed to surmount their disabilities so
often held by persons who have themselves struggled
up from the ranks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a12">12</span></p>

<p>“Fights” among the girls were not infrequent. One
unusually peaceful and happy evening, for instance,
ended in open warfare because Barbara Egan, apparently
with no evil intent, had asked Louisa Storm why
her fingers were so crooked. No less painful was the
quarrel between Mamie Taggart and Anna Strumpf,
which was recorded in the following entry in the
diary: “Tonight it was raining heavily but about eight
or ten girls of the Wednesday night club turned up.
Anna Strumpf sent word that she is not coming any
more as she is afraid that Mamie Taggart will do her
up outside.”</p>

<p>Not all the “fights” were duels; some of them were
petty wars of faction with faction. There was one particularly
unfortunate evening when fatal “remarks were
passed” and the deadly insult “tough” was used. The
waves of bitterness were long in subsiding. The next
evening a group of the girls, headed by Maggie Tracy
and Clara Denley, appeared at the club wearing large
stiff hair bows, some red and some black, which stuck
out defiantly on either side. They announced that
they had been called tough, so what could one expect?
The club leaders began to muster their diplomacy and
act as peacemakers, but the air was still belligerent
when the opposite faction came in.</p>

<p>Expecting a repetition of the clash between the two
sets, we were greatly surprised to see Sadie Fleming,
the leader of the newcomers, go up to Maggie Tracy
and put her hand affectionately on her enemy’s shoulder,
apparently forgetting that a state of war existed
between them. Sadie and her companions had collected
on their way to the club the most thrilling gossip
of the entire year. Father Langan, according to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a13">13</span>
story, on his way to give holy communion to a woman
who was sick, had been attacked by a gang of Gophers.
He had thrown open his coat to show the vestment of
the priest, but they had robbed him of some money he
was carrying and had left him stretched on the sidewalk!</p>

<p>This story was a nine-days’ wonder on the West Side,
where, as a usual thing, deeds of violence are promptly
forgotten. Father Langan flatly contradicted the
report, but this had no effect upon the currency of so
picturesque a story. Very likely there were other
quarrels besides Sadie’s and Maggie’s which were forgotten
and effaced in the mutual thrill over this piece
of modernized Irish folklore. Mrs. O’Callahan was
graphic, bringing together details heard from various
other sources as well.</p>

<p>“The father was just afther going t’ give a dyin’
woman th’ Holy Communion. He was stheppin’ down
the street when these fellows set in upon him. ‘B’ys,’
he sez, throwin’ back his coat and takin’ an’ showin’
thim th’ Sacrament which he had in his pocket, ‘d’ye
see what I’m carryin’ here? For yer own good,’ he
sez, ‘Oi warn ye,’ he sez, ‘not t’ lay hand on a priest,’
he sez, ‘an’ him goin’ t’ a sick old woman,’ he sez. An’
with that they hit him an’ took what money he had&mdash;twenty-six
dollars he was carryin’, so they say. Oi
can’t understand why the fire from above didn’t sthrike
thim down dead. In Ireland, a priest there has only
t’ stamp with his foot and they’d ha’ been sthruck down
where they stood. But America is a bad place, it ain’t
like th’ owld counthrey.”</p>

<p>When the youthful gang spirit of Tenth Avenue had
been conquered it seemed as though the last difficulty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a14">14</span>
had been surmounted. At the end of ten months we
thought we had taken the measure of all the unpropitious
influences that threatened our enterprise. But
not so. We were yet to capitulate to the last and
most powerful enemy of all&mdash;industry. First came a
“dispossess” notice, and before we could get our breath
from the surprise the house-wrecking crew were upon
us. It was a simple matter to raze “471” and the
adjoining buildings. In a few days they had all disappeared,
along with the tiny back yard, where the
children had played on hot summer days. On the site
was erected a lofty factory building. Tomorrow the
machines will be chugging away in the new shops,
tended perhaps by some of the same girls who yesterday
came knocking at the door of “471” asking for room
to play. A neighboring school received the remnants
of our clubs. With new conditions, a new environment,
and new groups of girls, an entirely new start
had to be made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The observations given in this study of girl life on
the West Side do not pretend to be extensive. No
attempt was made to gather in numbers. We had 65
girls in our clubs whose home conditions were very well
known.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> But the study was written with much additional
information in mind. Other girls came to the
house and we were in touch in one way or another with a
great many families of the neighborhood besides those
of club members. The chief purpose, however, was to
know intimately and sympathetically a small group of
girls who were typical in many ways of the girls
in any poor and neglected city population. As one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a15">15</span>
writer puts it: “The alternative lies, not between
knowing a few people and knowing all to an equal degree,
but between scratching the surface of the whole
field and digging a portion of it spade deep in order to
gain some idea of the under-soil throughout.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>How far did our groups represent the girl life of the
West Side? It was a comparatively small number
whom we knew, and the majority of them came from
the “under-soil.” The well cared for did not come
to us. Our girls were for the most part the daughters
of the poorest poor. As a group they differed essentially
from the types of girls usually found in settlement
clubs and classes. Some of them were not of the
best local repute. They were known as “tough,” and
had been practically outlawed by certain settlements
and recreation centers for the sake of the more promising
element.</p>

<p>The settlement workers in the district repeatedly
assured us that it was hard to hold the girls who came
from our particular area and impossible to work with
them in numbers. This testimony as to the unsocial
character of these girls was sadly borne out by
our experience in trying to organize them into clubs.
There were many who corresponded to the description
given by Dr. Katherine Bement Davis,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> superintendent
of Bedford Reformatory: “Our girls as a
class are anti-social. It is very hard for them to
see their conduct in its relation to the lives of those
around them. They are individualistic in the extreme.
They have never thought of the necessity for government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a16">16</span>
and law, and can see no reason for obedience to
anything but their own impulse.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>But after making all due allowances for the limited
number of girls studied and the “tough” reputations
of some of them, the fact remains that these 65 girls
and their friends were representative of many others
who are subjected to the same environment. They
had been brought up from babyhood in these blocks.
Born in the crowded, dark tenement house they had
had for a nursery the crowded sidewalk, and for a
playground, the street. They had gone to the nearest
school and from there to work in the nearest factory.
They had seen the West Side, breathed the
West Side, fed on the West Side for fourteen years
or more, and had built up their adolescent ideals
of the same forlorn material. That they had succumbed
to unwholesome influences does not prove
them to have been peculiarly weak or susceptible.
Nor does it prove that their parents had been culpably
delinquent in their duties. Conditions of living in
the crowded city have tended to loosen the family
bond, and the powerful force of neighborhood influence
cannot be adequately combated by parental
authority alone. The community must assume the
responsibility for the environment of its least protected
members.</p>

<p>A campaign for the control of conditions in the public
dance halls has been begun. We are told that our
young working girls must be given decent dance halls
and not publicly and deliberately consigned to the degraded
centers which attract them under that name.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a17">17</span>
The West Side girls need much more, however, than
protected dance halls. Some of the girls of this district
are too poor to go to public dances. But the same
dangers which threaten the dance-hall girl stalk unrestrained
through the neglected streets and tenements
of the West Side, and the girl of fourteen may fall a
victim even under her own roof tree.</p>

<p>Demoralizing neighborhood conditions, such as congestion,
filth, street temptations, and neighborhood
gangs, all of which are practically synonymous with
West Side life, influence the girls for evil only to a less
degree than they influence the boys. One needs only
to talk with any good mother of the district and hear
how steadily she is engaged in fending her children
against the life of the street to learn how constant
and how potent are its influences. Testimony is
borne to their power by the iterated complaint of
West Side mothers,&mdash;of those who do not work away
from home as well as of those who do,&mdash;that “Mamie
is beginning to get out from under me,” or, “Katie
was the best girl you ever saw until we came to live on
this block.”</p>

<p>The problem of waywardness among West Side girls
cannot be solved by long distance methods. Their
environment must be made safe and their pleasures
recognized and made decent. Some of the things which
enlightened criminologists recommend for women in reformatories,
after they have completely succumbed to
the sort of conditions which abound on the West Side,
are regular school attendance with manual training and
flexible courses of study; regular hours for sleep, for
food, for work, and for play; plenty of nourishing food;
fresh air and outdoor life; the social discipline of community
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a18">18</span>
life. These are the things which are given to
the girls in the reformatory at Bedford as a cure. The
same things would help to prevent; they would preserve
the West Side girl to society as a daughter and
as a mother, as a worker and as a citizen.

<span class="large">IN THE GRIP OF POVERTY<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></h2>

<p class="dropquote">“</p><p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">You’ve</span> got t’ keep your eye on a girl. Now
it’s different with a boy. He can take care
of himself. But you never can tell, if you
don’t keep a watch, when a girl’s goin’ to come back
an’ bring disgrace on you.”</p>

<p>Such, in a nutshell, is the attitude of our community
toward the adolescent girl. The chances are that she
will “never give you worry an’ trouble like a boy.”
But if she does, she will give vastly more. The sting
of her shame is felt to be keener than any the boy can
inflict. And with very few girls in our neighborhood
is “trouble” of this sort beyond the range of the
possible. Therefore the sense of family responsibility
is far more alert in her behalf than on her
brother’s account. With few exceptions, the girl is assured
of interest and counsel in her home. This counsel
is not always wise. Worse still, it is not always tempered
with the affection she needs. Here all family life
struggles against handicaps. But through all the sorry
failures, the ignorance, and the thwarted ambitions,
much love and much concern for the girl are to be
found in the homes of her people. Almost as a baby
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a20">20</span>
she has duties at home. The boy, as a rule, assumes
them with his first pay envelope. Or, if he is earlier
drafted into service, his chores are outside, probably
the gathering of coal or wood while his sister stays at
home to mind the babies. He has more freedom. She
grows up in a more intimate relation to the family, far
more under the eye of her mother. Therefore, family
influence, nine times out of ten, is the great factor in
her development. To understand her, home conditions
must be known.</p>

<p>The most common of family skeletons among this
West Side group is one which can scarcely be locked in
its closet. It stalks forth, apparent to the casual
glance. It is the grim elemental question of primitive
needs. The daily struggle for food, shelter, and clothing
is a stark reality to which only the youngest babies
in the family can be oblivious. The daughter of fourteen
knows it to the last sordid detail. In the group of
families we knew, poverty was almost universal. Of
our 65 girls only eight came from households which had
known continuous comfort during these children’s lives.
All the others had at some time faced staggering misfortune.
Forty of the total 55 families, or 73 per cent,
had had records with relief societies, some stretching
far back into the past.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Forty-three families, from
which came 53 of the girls, must be classed with the
very poor.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Those of us born into better fortune seldom feel the
meaning of this primitive struggle. We have no common
denominator with it. We cannot estimate the
heroism of “the poor.” We have heard and read much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a21">21</span>
of hunger and exposure. These things play a large
part in juvenile literature, whether sensational or classic.
There is no little daughter of a comfortable home but
is told the sad legend of the match girl who froze in the
snow under the lighted windows from which floated
sounds of merriment and music. The same little
daughter, grown older, goes to school and learns that
“man’s three primal necessities are food, shelter, and
clothing.” But neither the faraway and sentimental
pathos of the match girl’s fate nor the cold scholastic
statement of the text book is sufficient to teach one the
real meaning of poverty. Only those who follow its
trail, step by step, seeing the gradual and tragic disintegration
of human worth under its influence, the suffering
and waste left in its path, can realize its full
power and significance.</p>

<p>To these girls who come forth to their recreation in
a skirt worn thin and a gaping, ill-made waist, poverty
is neither distant nor sentimentally touching. Possibly
no child does starve in these streets. But there are
many children who do not need to learn out of books
about hunger. At any moment, one may open a door
and find it, in all its gaunt, staring reality. We once
found a tiny crippled baby who had sat for days in a
fireless, barren room, stiffened with cold. She was as
helpless and defenseless a little creature as could well
be met. But this was the treatment that an indifferent
community tolerated for her. And she was only one.</p>

<p>To our girls these were harsh facts of everyday knowledge.
Familiarity with poverty makes it seem both
more and less terrible. It does not kill, perhaps, but
it stunts. It does not come as an overwhelming catastrophe;
but steadily it saps the vigor of the young as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a22">22</span>
well as of the old. With the more fortunate of families
such as these, extreme poverty is only episodic. A
fairly decent standard is kept until something goes
amiss. But one break in the machinery of their working
capacity means hardship. No reserve fund has
been possible, or the small amount saved is hopelessly
inadequate to meet illness or protracted unemployment.
It melts away in a few weeks or months. The
family is very soon over the borderline of self-support.
With the less fortunate, poverty takes the form of a
slow, chronic contest against everlasting odds. This
demands every atom of physical and nervous strength,
every fraction of intelligence and effort. And the
exaction is made from those whose only training has
been hard, devastating experience.</p>

<p>In this neighborhood, families are large and wages are
small. The size of the family is a definite element in
its standard of comfort. Poverty begins not merely at
a certain wage but also with a certain number of children.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
“We’ve got eight,” said Mrs. Meehan, “and
by rights we’d only have two if we was to bring ’em up
proper. But,” she added, “it’s the littlest one that I
love the best.”</p>

<p>Sometimes where the father is living and at work, he
earns enough to keep in cleanliness and health, and with
at least the necessary medical care, a family of three or
four. But with six to support, an income sufficient for
four means the lack of essentials for all, loss of health,
and sometimes loss of life. Often the mother is compelled
to supplement his earnings by her own. Twenty-nine
out of the 46 living mothers were contributing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a23">23</span>
part or the whole of the family income. In 24 of the 55
families the father was dead or incapacitated, and there
was no stepfather to take his place as breadwinner.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The mortality among children on the West Side is
shockingly high. A family which had not lost at least
one child was indeed rare. Fairly accurate records of
the births and deaths of children in 31 out of the 55
families show that the number of births averaged nearly
eight, and the deaths about three.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> This average death
rate for so small a group is not surprising when one
considers the birth rate. The more children that are
born into such poverty, the greater the likelihood that
many of them will die. On our list were families who
had two living children and six dead, five living and five
dead, five living and six dead, six living and nine dead,
seven living and seven dead, one living and six dead.
Though practically all these families carried insurance,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
the amount for which a baby’s life is insured would not
as a rule be sufficient to pay the expense of burial.</p>

<p>The attitude of our community toward birth or
death is disheartening in its helplessness. Either event
is accepted as the will of God. The idea of voluntarily
limiting the size of the family is almost unknown. Mrs.
Reilly, bent, deformed, old at fifty, with five children
living and eight dead, would ramble on with her dull
and listless story of the sickness and suffering those
deaths and births had meant, and the constant crushing
poverty they had caused; and would finish with,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a24">24</span>
“It’s the poor as can’t take care of them, to whom
they’re sent.”</p>

<p>The housing of these families was of a grade commensurate
with the degree of their poverty. Dark, unventilated
rooms were found in the apartments of 30 families,
and about half of the group of 55 had less space than
was required for health or comfort. As is generally
true with families of their class, the amount of rent
paid for poor and inadequate accommodations was
relatively high.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>In spite of the mountains of difficulty in the way of
these mothers, their success in bringing up their children
is sometimes great beyond our realization. There
was, for instance, one household on a certain block on
Eleventh Avenue where the father brought in $12 in
return for a full week of unskilled labor. There were
four children under working age. Twelve dollars, six
persons, city prices&mdash;this was the mother’s problem,
by no means so discouraging as that of some of her
neighbors, but still a difficult one. The answer is not
to be written on paper. It is on children’s faces, in the
events and outcome of human lives. However successful
the present answer, each day sets the old quandary
forth anew. Never solved, it stretches on into the
years ahead.</p>

<p>With this family, part of the answer was their presence
on Eleventh Avenue. It was in the clangor of the
freight trains that passed on the street surface by their
door and blackened their windows with smoke. It
was in the stench of the slaughter house which the breeze
brought into their rooms. It was in the soot of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a25">25</span>
factories and the dangers to child life around the docks.
There were outward evidences of family life in the block
where they dwelt&mdash;dilapidated tenements, with a
sordid little grocery store in the middle of the block.
A garish little saloon stood on the corner. The houses
did not present the solid red brick front of the usual
tenement street, with its delusive appearance of respectability.
The buildings were irregular; some
were low and shack-like. Their windows faced Jersey
and the nightly glory of the sunset, but even this could
not redeem the sordidness and squalor of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>From these surroundings came two trim little figures.
They were school girls, still with all the ways and traits
of little girls. Their hair was drawn smoothly into
straight black braids. Their eyes were round and
wide awake. The neatness of their dress spoke of
continual care. They were alert and well-mannered,
brimming with interest and comment. In short, they
were bright, normal, ordinary children. What this
meant as an achievement can only be measured by the
obstacles which this one mother had overcome.</p>

<p>She had had the help neither of good fortune
nor of training. She had fashioned her product with her
own pitiful, clumsy tools. A large-boned, uncouth
Irish woman, she still bore the stamp of the soil. Her
education had been that of life, a life of hard knocks and
rough going. Plain, coarse, with the burr in her speech,
bent and weakened physically, she did not present an
attractive appearance. But it was her boast that she
“never got anything from no society&mdash;never knew much
about them places&mdash;never had to, thank God.” Relatives
had helped when the hardest pinches came; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a26">26</span>
for the most part the family had plodded on alone.
But even such parents cannot master poverty. In
turn they must pay toll to its resistless strength. For
the smallest girl of five was a wan, great-eyed baby
whose puckered lips were drawn with pain and on
whom the shadow of death already lay. The terms of
life cannot be utterly remade.</p>

<p>In one of the sordid tenements wedged into a narrow
space as yet unclaimed by business this mother had
found a shelter for her brood. Four rooms “through”
with a cupboard were rented to her for $9.00 a month
and her services as janitress, which were reckoned as
worth $3.00. Thus, while her flat would otherwise have
cost $12 a month and have absorbed exactly one week
of her husband’s wages, she saved $3.00 out of the
rent to spend on food for her family of six. This was
the important fact which had kept them on Eleventh
Avenue from year to year, though the mother always
hoped that each winter would be her last in the
house.</p>

<p>But not all families have the fortitude, the endurance,
the power of ceaseless, undiminished effort which this
particular group possessed. Even with those who
accept the challenge and make the continual effort to
keep their heads above water, strength and courage
sometimes break. The loss of two days’ work for a
daughter whose full week’s wage amounts to only
$4.00 or $5.00 may mean a family tragedy. What elsewhere
are incidents, are hazards here.</p>

<p>We have fallen into the habit of looking to the mother
as the mainstay of the family. She is held to a rigorous
standard which neither husband nor children are required
to measure up to. We expect her to counteract
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a27">27</span>
the difficulties and evil influences of her environment
by possessing all the known virtues of character. As a
matter of fact, the worry and strain of insecurity become
too great for many a woman. She grows apathetic,
careless, and stolid, or she becomes querulous and
neurotic. Perhaps she takes to drink. Drinking is
rife on the West Side; it is the easy and familiar
escape from worry and discouragement. For the
woman who drinks there is scant sympathy or toleration.
The decent, hardworking mother has no patience
with her. If the victim is putting up any fight at all
it is a desperate and a solitary one, for she can expect
no help from others. With every lapse, every slipping
back from the precarious foothold gained so painfully,
she is met by scorn and reproach from her judges with
whom the long weeks of effort do not count when once
she has failed. To rise many times from the utmost
depths of despair and bitterness is not given to human
nature, and she ends as an outcast.</p>

<p>I am thinking of one black, terrible half hour with a
woman of my acquaintance. A thunder storm darkened
all the outer world and almost no light entered the
kitchen where we sat. It was one of the two small rear-house
rooms that she rented for $8.50 a month. This
day it was stifling and unswept, cluttered with little
piles of her rubbish. She was going to move; she had
been dispossessed. She had lost her job, a position held
for three months after a winter when she had hunted
work for weeks. For seven years she had kept up a
home for her girl and boy, one year during the illness of
her husband who drank and beat her, and six years
after his death. She had looked forward to the time
when Sadie should get her working papers; but the girl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a28">28</span>
was incompetent and irresponsible and failed to keep
any job for long.</p>

<p>This year had brought the mother her first out-of-work
experience. In the course of it she had slipped far
behind. But with every seven dollars’ pay during the
past three months she had climbed slowly back. The
rent was even. The insurance agent lacked a single
dollar. Every night on coming home she had figured
slowly and clumsily with the aid of her boy “Petie.”
She had “built castles, which no one had ought to do.”
Castles! Dreams of a new suit for herself and Sadie,
of whole shoes for Petie which should not be begged
from his school; dreams in the future of an “all-through”
apartment, even with rugs, and curtains of cheap lace.
But again thrown out of work, hope was gone.</p>

<p>She was a woman slow and clumsy of movement,
who went through her plodding days quietly and
dumbly, with a certain trembling hesitance. But her
rusty black clothes were always neat. The housekeeper
said, “You c’d tell she was respectable.” It was
a cherished respectability. She suffered bitter pangs
when she saw it fall away. Today her tongue was
loosened by drink. She talked quickly, with an unaccustomed
rise and fall of speech, and with fluency of
gesture. She clung to Petie, possessed with the idea
that some one was trying to take him away. “They
shall not take me boy. The girl is wild; she has me
heart broke. I’ve worked and I’ve tried an’ it’s all
come to this. But I won’t be parted fr’m me boy.”
And again and again, the voice rising to a cry, “I’ve
been turned down&mdash;turned down I am. I’m not a young
woman now an’ you know I can’t stand it&mdash;turned
down hard I’ve been.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a29">29</span></p>

<p>Without doubt some women of the dependent classes
are strongly braced in their morals by the rigorous
standard to which we hold them. The consciousness
that nothing but the best of conduct will be excused in
them must serve as a constant stimulus to heroic living.
But on the other hand, there are doubtless many who
have drifted to the bottom as the result of a first lapse
which might have been excused and survived under a
less rigorous standard. There are too many who share
the decent working woman’s point of view. “When a
woman takes to the can, she ain’t got no good left.”</p>

<p>Many of our girls came from homes where the parents
were heavy and constant drinkers.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> They were
familiar with the appearance of drunkenness. It does
not revolt such girls when it breaks out in a place of
amusement. They do not resent it in their boy
companions but view it on the whole with unconcern.
But they come to be wary of its manifestations in others
and even unconsciously expert in inebriate psychology.
There was one family where the alcoholic father was
always turned over to the fourteen-year-old daughter
during his “sprees” to be managed. When he was in
this condition she was “the only one who could do
anything with him.” Surely an ominous ability for a
fourteen-year-old daughter!</p>

<p>In a neighborhood like the Middle West Side, poverty
is seldom found isolated from its menacing concomitants&mdash;ignorance,
immorality, drinking, filth, and degradation.
Whether as cause or result, these appear as
close companions of want. Some of our girls came from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a30">30</span>
families which hovered constantly on the verge of disruption.
The arrogant, decisive power of the law
always hung over them like the sword of Damocles,
threatening dismemberment.</p>

<p>Here was Annie Brink, who came to her club with
Hyde and Jekyll moods. Sometimes she was gentle
and tractable. Sometimes she looked out sullenly from
a cloud of morbid depression and gloom impossible to
pierce. She had grown up in a world of sudden disasters.
Almost from babyhood she had been a household
drudge. There were seven children in the family and
Annie, the eldest daughter, was early pressed into
service as general houseworker and nurse for the
younger ones. To take proper care of seven young
children is too big a job for one woman, and Annie’s
mother was certainly much too gay and irresponsible
by disposition to attempt it. “There was seven of us
kids,” said Annie, “so I had to help. I wasn’t let out
on the street much when I was little. One house
where we were had a back yard and we’d play there.
But then we moved. When we went on to Tenth
Avenue there was a fire escape. We’d take pillows out
there and sit. It was just grand. Then I always could
play on the organ. It was mamma’s since she married,
but she don’t use it any more. It’s the same as mine
now. It stays locked, because if all seven of us used it
there wouldn’t be any organ soon.”</p>

<p>At nine, Annie was a shy and backward child. Then
she lost the sight of one eye by infecting it from an
abscessed finger. The new physical defect kept her out
of school and the housekeeping was transferred more
and more to her young shoulders. She had never had
a friend of her own age until at thirteen she attached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a31">31</span>
herself to a girl of a vigorous personality. Agnes was
rough and quick to strike, like a boy, strong and
generous. She protected her new friend and took her
out to see the world. They went to a school recreation
center several blocks north and Agnes saw that Annie
was not molested on their way. “We wasn’t afraid of
anything with Agnes.” Then abruptly the strong
protector was removed by a yet stronger power.
Agnes was “put away.” Annie reported, “They won’t
let her out till she is twenty-one. They’re awful
strict. It makes us all feel bad.”</p>

<p>Such things are accepted happenings in Annie’s
world. They are the acts of a power quite beyond its
influence. Annie took the loss of her champion with
philosophy and stayed at home once more. She did
not dare go to the recreation center alone. Then came
another thunderbolt. Her mother, who had entered
upon the familiar way of middle-aged West Side women
who lack the stamina that the grim struggle demands,
was brought into court, charged with drunkenness, and
sentenced to the workhouse. The smaller brothers
and sisters were also taken away. Since then life had
been one succession of strange women brought in as
housekeepers. There were interludes between trials
of the various incompetents when the full care fell
on the young girl. She was in school only a few hours
a day, because her single eye had been weakened. She
had grown up on the edge of a volcano. At fourteen
she was, by her school record, “peevish and extremely
stubborn and difficult to handle.”</p>

<p>Such precarious conditions of living are especially
unfavorable for the adolescent daughter. The instability
of her age is accentuated by the uncertainties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a32">32</span>
of her life. Foresight and steadiness of purpose are
not easily taught when the essentials of existence depend
upon chance. The girl sees around her all sorts
of makeshifts and haphazard expedients. One of our
girls tried to avert a family disaster. Dispossession
threatened at the end of the week. Mrs. Derks was
in despair, and helplessly she resigned the situation to
Emma. With their last $3.00 the girl bought a lamp
and some hundreds of printed tickets. The lamp was
put in a saloon window. The tickets were to be sold
in a raffle which was to pay the rent. They did not
sell and the rent went unpaid. “I told her it
wouldn’t do no good,” a neighbor said. “She should a’
got a watch.”</p>

<p>But as poverty is the enemy of adolescence, adolescence
is the adversary of poverty. The vivifying forces
of youth are a protection against the depleting effects
of want and insecurity. The girl does not take to drink
as her mother does. Weeks of want are quickly forgotten
in a following period of comfort. When kindliness
and cheer once more prevail in her home, consciousness
of the lack of ease and loveliness is shaken
from her. With the buoyancy of youth she rebounds
at the slightest release. But all too often her respite
is brief, and when periods of want follow too closely
upon each other, her powers of recovery must fail.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a33">33</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="large">WHERE THE SCHOOL LAW FAILED</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> five or six years of age, the girl starts to
school; between fourteen and sixteen, she
leaves school for good and goes to work. The
eight or nine years which lie between make up the full
period of her formal education. She must acquire during
these years of compulsory school attendance all
the “learning” which the law of the state fixes as a
minimum for its workers.</p>

<p>She has a wide choice of schools. Between Thirty-eighth
and Forty-third Streets are the buildings of
four different systems. The public schools, the parochial
schools, the Children’s Aid Society school, and the
American Female Guardian Society school are all waiting
with open arms to receive her. Often she is simply
sent to the nearest school building. To cross the
crowded avenues is more or less hazardous for a six-year-old.
Or, she is taken by an older child to the school
attended by her protector. In this case, it is “Mary’s
school” that is chosen, and the various systems mentioned
have nothing to do with the decision. Sometimes,
however, one of them is chosen by the parents
because of its particular specialty. The church school
teaches “prayers,” the “soup” school, as the Children’s
Aid Society is called in the neighborhood, gives a free
lunch and shoes and warm red petticoats. The children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a34">34</span>
of the poorest poor are likely to go there. The public
schools are in general considered best for “learning.”</p>

<p>After the original choice has been made, neither
parents nor child feel bound to stick to it. A great
deal of shifting about takes place, only a small part
of which is necessary. Some of the local schools carry
their pupils only through the primary classes and must
then transfer their small graduates to another building
and another street to enter the grammar grades. For
many reasons, this single change may be wise, but very
often it is only the beginning of a succession of transfers.
The break is an occasion to try out two or three new
places before settling down. In the meantime, the little
wanderer goes through a period of unsettled plans, and
incidentally loses considerable time from her lessons.</p>

<p>A free choice of schools and a free use of the transfer
are the chief concessions made by the compulsory school
law to parental authority. As a matter of fact, it is
not always parental authority which transfers little
Mamie from school to school, but the child’s own
flitting, aimless spirit. In the middle of a term, for
almost any cause, she is likely to drop out of her class
and claim the right to transfer. A quarrel with a
schoolmate, a friend in another school, a dispute with
the teacher,&mdash;these are the sort of trivial reasons
which result in sudden transfers.</p>

<p>Our girls had made the most of their transfer privileges.
One of them had attended nine different schools
on the West Side; another had attended eight; two
had attended seven; one had attended six; two had
attended five; and four had attended four; 16 had attended
three; 21 had attended two; and only eight
had continued throughout in the same school. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a35">35</span>
were five girls who had come from institutions, and
four whose school careers were unknown.</p>

<p>These interruptions mean a serious waste from the
girl’s meager allowance of time for schooling. She
passes at each shift to a new set of teachers who know
nothing of her record and tendencies. Frequently she
is put back a grade. She resents this, grows discouraged,
and perhaps loses interest. Besides, so much ease in
changing weakens the school’s authority. It is, however,
a safeguard against the rigidity of a single autocratic
system. It gives some room for experiment with
a difficult child, until the régime and the teacher with
whom she will fit may be found. A restriction of the
transfer would certainly be a blow to the truant officer’s
method of dealing with girls. At present it constitutes
his one suggestion, his only “golden cure.”</p>

<p>The girl’s schooling begins to suffer as soon as there
is any especial need for assistance at home.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Two or
three days are dropped repeatedly. Wage-earning sisters
cannot stop at home to nurse an invalid or care
for younger children while the mother works. When
a new baby comes, it is the oldest school girl who
carries the extra burden of work. Even the most
devoted mothers make these encroachments on the
time which belongs to the school. They are driven to
it by necessity. “What can I do? There ain’t nobody
else and I’ve got to keep Mamie t’ help.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Kersey went to the hospital, it was
“Baby,” the eleven-year-old daughter, who was kept
out of school to do the work, and not her older sister
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a36">36</span>
employed in a factory. “You ought t’ ’a’ seen how
Baby run our house,”&mdash;her wage-earning sister was
giving the account. “Gee, but she was that strict, <i>believe
me</i>. I couldn’t have a cent o’ my money. No
shows them days fer mine. She cried if me father
didn’t give ’er his pay an’ she made him, too. She’d
give him his quarter fer shavin’ money, but not a cent
more. An’ she bought everythin’ an’ run things herself.
Me mother was away sick fer nine months.
Baby, she’s an awful good girl.”</p>

<p>Emma Larkey, having at last struggled up to Class
5B, had just dropped out of school for good. She was
normal in body and mind. She should have been in
the graduating class. Why wasn’t she? In the first
place, she had changed schools eight times since her
start, wandering indifferently from public to parochial
school and then back again. In the second place, there
were five younger children and she was constantly
being kept at home. The mother patched grain sacks
in order to pay rent for a well lighted apartment of five
rooms. “There are nine of us, and if I don’t work,
we’d have to crowd up an’ sleep in those black stuffy
bedrooms. I can’t bear for the children to do that.”
Decent living quarters and fresh air for the whole
family seemed more important than Emma’s schooling.
Something must give way under such pressure and so
it was Emma who went down. She had braced her
young shoulders to tasks more difficult than school
lessons and had lost all desire to finish the grammar
grades by the time the second girl was old enough to
relieve her at home.</p>

<p>The result of so much absence was seen in the great
retardation among our girls. Thirteen to fifteen is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a37">37</span>
regarded as the normal age for graduation,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and by this
standard only 10 of our 65 girls were in the normal
grade. All the rest were “laggards.” There were, for
instance, 35 girls who were fourteen years old, the
normal age for graduation. Some of them had gone to
work, while others were still in school. The grades
they had left or were still attending are shown in the
following distribution: Two had reached the 3B grade;
four, 4A; three, 4B; one, 5A; four, 5B; four, 6A; four,
6B; five, 7A; three, 7B; and four, 8A. One girl had
been in an institution. The girls are thus seen to have
been distributed almost impartially from the third to
the eighth grade. There was for them practically no
relation between age and grade.</p>

<p>An occasional girl is defiantly truant. Her refusal to
fit into the school system marks a deeper vein of rebellion
than in the case of the boy, who more commonly
slips the leading strings. Or else it marks an undeveloped
body and spirit in dealing with which the
usual forcible methods of combating truancy are often
ineffectual.</p>

<p>Annie Gibson was a slim, undersized girl of fifteen.
Her light, almost colorless hair hung down around
small, undeveloped features, strikingly vacant and
weak. Her teeth, very small and deeply set, might have
been the milk teeth of a well-developed baby. Surrounded
by a cover of reticence and a surface of
embarrassment, her real thoughts were impossible to
discover. She would agree to anything but would
seldom volunteer an opinion of her own.</p>

<p>In school she was a passive pupil, never “giving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a38">38</span>
trouble” but learning little, and her attendance record
was very low. In time she furnished-one of the most
stubborn cases of truancy in the school and the
truant officer was sent after her. He found her at
home alone, the girl’s mother being away at her regular
work as chambermaid in a hotel. As the officer laid his
hand on her arm to take her back to school, the child’s
passivity suddenly broke and she flung herself on the
floor, screaming. The man retreated in consternation,
fearful that he might be accused of having physically
mishandled the child, while Annie was left to recover
from her hysterical outbreak as well as she could. This
is only one instance of the futility of applying our
present method of dealing with truancy to these exceptional
cases. This child was primarily in need of careful
mental and physical examination and probably of
special training which could only be defined after such
an examination had been made.</p>

<p>When the difficulty rests with the girl there is no
course between threats and a sentence of great severity.
The parent may be fined, but then the punishment does
not fall on the child. If she is sent away it must be
to a reformatory, not to a school. Let us see how these
methods would work applied to Christina Cull, another
of our girls who was a stubborn truant. At fourteen,
she had reached Class 4A. She had not “made her
days”; that is, attended school for 130 days during the
year prior to her fourteenth birthday. Nor had she gone
far enough in her classes to get her working papers. But
Christina refused to pass the doorway of a school. She
had gone far beyond the influence of the ordinary school.</p>

<p>Five years before, one of the Catholic fathers had
found her loitering in the rear of his church. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a39">39</span>
soon after Christmas and he stopped to ask about her
holiday. She answered shortly that she had had
neither presents nor a good time. His interest in the
pathetic, sullen child took him later to her home. The
family was squalidly poor. They lived in three dark
basement rooms, without comfort or decency. The
father, after four years of desertion, had returned
home in the final stage of tuberculosis to be cared for
until his death.</p>

<p>Christina had grown into a forbidding girl. Her face
was so lined and so hard that she looked years older
than she was. The childlike effect of her flowing hair
and long bangs contrasted oddly with the age and hardness
of her features. She might almost have been a
middle-aged woman masquerading as a little girl. The
truant officer went after her time and again, only to
listen to the mother’s repeated complaint. Christina
was “out from under” her; she went where she listed.
Threats were long since outworn and useless. She had
heard them from babyhood. “Aw&mdash;they talk but they
won’t do nothin’.” Occasionally she would grow
frightened and penitent for the moment. But re-enter
the ordinary school and sit in the classes with the
younger children, she would not.</p>

<p>No course was left but to take the culprit before the
superintendent and enter a formal complaint against
her. There would then be two plans of action which
might be followed: Christina’s mother&mdash;her father had
died in the meantime&mdash;might be fined in the magistrate’s
court or Christina might be committed to a reformatory.
To fine the mother of a family already on
the verge of dependency was manifestly futile. On
the other hand, a reformatory sentence for a girl whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a40">40</span>
only offense was that she refused to go to school seemed
much too severe. In the face of this dilemma no action
at all was taken. Christina, without working papers,
without work, was left to employ her illegal holidays
in her own way. Her only chance for positive discipline
was that she might soon become a serious offender for
whom a reformatory sentence might not be too severe.
For girls like Christina the only remedy seems to be that
they shall grow worse before they can grow better.
Such a roundabout and wasteful course might be obviated
if we had a truant school for girls, as we already
have for boys, especially planned for their needs.</p>

<p>It is a common occurrence for a girl to escape from
school at thirteen or fourteen without open defiance of
the labor law. Of our 65 girls, at least nine had left
school illegally. Their escape was accomplished by
petty frauds of various kinds. One girl gave the school
a false address; another altered the date on her birth
certificate. Two had been absent for illness and had
never returned. Others simply “dropped out” and
their defection was not followed up by the school, which
with its limited number of attendance officers is bound
to neglect many such cases. These are some of the
usual loopholes by which the girl evades the school law.</p>

<p>The young refugee does not always find it easy to get
her working papers at once. The required record of
130 days’ attendance during the previous year is a
serious stumbling block, although it allows for 70
absences out of a possible 200 attendances. In the
public schools she has to reach a 5B grade<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> and pass an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a41">41</span>
educational test before the school papers which she
must present at the board of health are signed. There
the mental test is simpler&mdash;a mere proof of ability to
read and write. She is tested on two or three primer
sentences, such as, “Is my mother in this room?” She
is then weighed and measured; and occasionally a
child much under average is rejected. Failing in any
of the requirements, the girl must wait until she is
sixteen, when she may legally go to work without
papers. In the meantime she helps at home, or “lives
out,” or finds an employer who is willing to connive at
her lack of working papers.</p>

<p>These are the girls who evade the law. Those who are
obedient to its requirements are scarcely less eager to
escape. Almost without exception, the girls of our
district step eagerly forth from the school at the earliest
possible moment. Not a girl of our clubs had stayed in
school longer than the law required or long enough to
“graduate” from the eighth grade. To continue in
school after you can get your working papers is a sign
of over-education and is not popular.</p>

<p>In thus leaving school as soon as the law allows,
family need very often plays a part. Sometimes the
younger girl has begun to lend a hand during vacations.
The Donovans tell how “Sissy” got a job at eleven.
It was the summer when both parents were ill and out
of work. They still chuckle with appreciation of Sissy’s
enterprise. “You’d ought to ha’ seen her. She let
down her skirts and done up her hair. She was just a
bit o’ a thing&mdash;not twelve then. She come out one
mornin’ an’ said, ‘Ma, I’m goin’ to go to work’s well as
Mame.’ We laughed at ’er but she set out. So that
day she come back an’ sure enough she’d got a job in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a42">42</span>
chewin’ gum fact’ry, wrappin’ packages. There was
a graphophone an’ at lunch time all the girls danced.
Oh, she had a grand time, be-<i>lieve me</i>. There was a lot
o’ little girls whose mothers were poor. When the
inspector come, they’d hide Sissy under the table. We
most died laughin’ when she brought her first week’s
pay&mdash;85 cents! Now, what d’ye think about that?
She come in here an’ give it t’ me as proud ’s if it had
been dollars instead.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that after a vacation adventure
like this Sissy began to lose interest in school. Working
in a factory is not all fun, but it brings a measure
of independence which the young personality craves
beyond all else. It is not always stern need alone
which sends the girl out to work at such an early age.
Parents may call on her in times of special stress and
insist on her returning to school as soon as the pressure
is removed. But public opinion among the girls themselves
is strong and decided on this point. “I don’t
mind studyin’, but all my friends are goin’ t’ work, an’
I don’t want t’ stay. My mother an’ brothers all
holler at me, but I’m kickin’ to leave. Graduate?
Gee, stay two years? Not for me&mdash;it’s too slow.”</p>

<p>The girl’s restlessness demands at this age something
very new and vivid. This the school has so far failed
to supply. She thinks she may find it in work. And
by the time she has discovered that work too grows
tedious and monotonous, her greater independence has
enabled her to make free use of her evenings for the
changes and new experiences she craves.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="large">WAGE-EARNING AND NEW RELATIONS
AT HOME</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Our</span> West Side girl sets out some morning, short-skirted,
hair in braids, absurdly childish, to
find her minute place in the great industrial
world. Probably she strolls through the streets, looking
for “Girl Wanted” signs. She will try at one of
the big factories nearby. Or, if she is fortunate, some
friend who is already working there speaks for her.
The more enterprising buy the <i>World</i> and consult its
long columns of advertisements.</p>

<p>The West Side factories take in the majority of the
work seekers. A few with especial pretensions to “refinement,”
or whose families sincerely dread the physical
strain and supposedly lower social and moral standards
of the factory, go into department stores or become
errand girls to milliners or dressmakers. But most
of the girls prefer the higher wages of the factory.
Lizzie Wade, herself a laundry worker, was perfectly
clear in her sixteen-year-old mind as to the advantages
of factory work over department store work. “In the
first place,” she pointed out, “the factory girl gets
better pay, and if she hasn’t any home, she can always
get a family to live with. The girl that works in a
store lives in the cheapest boarding houses, and gets
soaked for her board just the same.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a44">44</span></p>

<p>Few sixteen-year-old workers are as wise as Lizzie.
Many of them, no doubt, are vaguely influenced by
reasons just as practical in preferring the factory to the
store, though they are less able to express them. But
if they are asked to justify their preferences, they are
likely to return very childish answers. “Tootsie”
O’Brien had achieved her working papers at fourteen
and a half and was looking for a place. It was significant
that Tootsie, who had qualified as a wage-earner,
had not yet outgrown her baby name at home. She
was willing to take any kind of work, she said, but liked
housework best. She wanted to “live out” because
her brother was always fighting with her. However,
she soon changed her mind, as her sister, who had been
a servant before her marriage, told her that she wouldn’t
be allowed out when at service. She finally went to
work in a factory.</p>

<p>Girls of this type do the most unskilled work in the
entire scale of factory occupations. They are not
equal to the high grade, skilled work of the garment
trades and textile industries. An inquiry concerning
the occupations of 26 girls showed the following results:
One was a trimmer in a necktie factory; three
were folding or slip-sheeting in bookbinderies; one
was rolling wall paper; one was working in a tin can
factory, operating a machine which fixed the bails in
lard cans; nine were packers or wrappers in factories
producing biscuits, candy, cigarettes, or drugs; three
were markers and shakers in steam laundries; eight
were errand girls and messengers for milliners or
dressmakers.</p>

<p>These occupations are patently without educational
value. The factory processes are the sort of lightweight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a45">45</span>
machine work usually assigned to young girls
after the last drop of individual responsibility has been
squeezed out. Their chief characteristic is a degree of
monotony in which no discipline for the young worker
is possible because their effect is stupefaction. The
work soon palls on the girl’s restless spirit. Martie
Sheridan, after five months of this grinding monotony,
secretly cut the belt of her machine just to get a day
off. Another girl probably, long before the end of
five months, would have thrown up her job and tried
another, if not several others.</p>

<p>Finding a new place is always something of an adventure,
and in the process of shifting she enjoys a
few days of freedom. Pauline Stark, throughout her
four years of wage-earning, had been a “rover.” She had
had no trouble in finding new places and had tried so
many that she had lost count of the number. “I see
a sign up an’ I go an’ try. Then sometimes I meet
some one I know. I stop an’ get to talking an’ mebbe
I won’t look any more that day. But it don’t take
long. Sometimes I throw up a job the first day. I
can tell. I take a look around an’ see that it ain’t for
me. Then I work out the day an’ don’t go back.”</p>

<p>It is difficult for the girls to give an accurate account
as to where they have worked and the changes they
have made. They are hazy as to places and quite unreliable
as to the length of stay. With great effort we
pieced together the industrial histories of girls who had
been employed for some time. Although most of them
had been at work less than a year, they had tried a
great number of occupations. The 30 wage-earners in
our club mustered among them 120 different jobs,
an average of four apiece. Two girls of sixteen had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a46">46</span>
held 12 positions each; one girl of sixteen, 10 positions;
and one fifteen-year-old had had nine. One-third of
the 30 had had five or more positions. These instances
give some idea of the way in which the girl of fourteen
and fifteen flits from job to job. It is no wonder that
she is inaccurate concerning the details of her industrial
experience when each connection is so brief and episodic.
A further reason for her haziness is that her point of contact
with the great factory and its processes is so slight.
Nellie Sherin, aged fourteen, worked in one of the largest
and best of the West Side factories. Her childish
description of her work is the best indication of her
incompetence. “I have to run a machine that pastes
the labels. If you don’t get the boxes in right the knife
breaks and a man comes and hollers at you.”</p>

<p>The girl of this class accepts in a matter-of-fact way
conditions of work that impress the outsider as very
hard. Sometimes she tells of having cried with weariness
when she started. But complaints of the long
day, the meager reward, and the monotony are few.
She has not thought out the general aspects of the
factory. Comparisons between individual places are
constant, as also are personal grievances, usually
against a “cranky forelady.” She rebels against the
tediousness of her job. “You can hear talkin’ all
over our room when the forelady goes out. Then
we’ll hear her comin’ in an’ it stops short. Soon’s
she goes, we all start again.” As often as not she
throws up her job for a personal grievance&mdash;a quarrel
with another worker, a grudge against a “boss.”
Fanny Mullens left the Excelsior Laundry because
her friend quarreled with the foreman and Fanny’s
loyalty would not permit her to remain. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a47">47</span>
human factor is the strongest with these young
workers.</p>

<p>The girl starts in a store at $3.00 or $3.50 a week;
in a factory, at $4.00 or $5.00. The 26 wage-earning
girls concerning whom information was obtained were
receiving sums which varied from $3.00 to $7.50. Of
this group, three were earning $3.00 or $3.50; eight
were earning $4.00, and eight were earning $5.00. Thus
19 out of 26 were earning $5.00 or less. The remaining
seven girls were receiving $6.00 or over; three received
$6.00; two, $6.50; and two, $7.50.</p>

<p>One of the girls earning $6.00 had been working five
years; another earning the same amount had been working
but a few months. Of the two girls earning $7.50,
one had been working four years in the same position
and the other five months. As far as our little group
of girls was concerned, there was no connection between
age or experience and wages. Practically all the
girls were doing such unskilled work that additional
years and additional experience were idle commodities.
There was, on the other hand, some divergence between
what the different factories of the district were
accustomed to pay for the same grade of labor.</p>

<p>Along with her first humble job and her first meager
wage, there comes to the young girl her first taste of
power. Her first pay envelope is the outward and
visible sign of many changes. Her position at home is
altered. She has more prestige, the first beginning of
authority. Her family may be actually dependent for
comfort on what she brings in. This gives to her
desires and wishes a new importance. However autocratic
her parents’ rule may have been, they must now
turn to her for assistance. There must follow a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a48">48</span>
loosening of the reins. Every now and again there is a
girl who in these early, headstrong years will press her
advantage to the full.</p>

<p>To these girls has come the age of self-assertion.
The experience is common to adolescence of becoming
intensely aware of oneself. With the new intensity
of self-consciousness comes the desire to assume control.
At this age the girl resents being “bossed.”
It is the time when many families feel the increased
friction between brothers and sisters. Interference
and guidance need to be gentle. Because the girl is
young she is apt to be extreme and her assertion will
often be crass and ill-balanced. These are traits of
the adolescent girl of all classes, but this phase among
our girls is accentuated sharply by a very definite set
of circumstances.</p>

<p>Tradition still upholds her parents’ authority. What
they ask from her is their right. They are backed by
the practical code of morals which, in any community,
counts more than many sermons. Public opinion demands
the continued subservience of both boy and
girl. The precarious state of family wellbeing has instituted
a rigid system of household economics; this is
needed for mere preservation. It is zealously guarded
by the mother, ever the most wary of anything which
threatens the group. According to custom she is the
spender. All wages come to her untouched; the broken
envelope violates the social standard. Husband, sons,
and daughters alike are supposed to come under this
rule. There should be no exception until the children
reach the age of eighteen or nineteen. The mother
doles out spending money according to the needs and
the earnings of each.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a49">49</span></p>

<p>There is no pity felt by her world for the girl who
must turn over her meager pay. This is a duty taken
for granted. It is the least return for the years during
which her parents have made sacrifice and effort for
her. The feeling has reason for holding good while
economic conditions remain as they are. Each item
in the family income is far too important for the girl
to escape her toll. She is born to a contest in which
she, too, must take part. Only a lucky accident can
free her from this inheritance,&mdash;accident or rebellion.
The pay envelope passes through her hands, and this
means the possibility of some independence. At least
the choice is hers to give grudgingly or freely. With the
responsibilities which come to her so much earlier than
to those more sheltered, comes also this earlier power.</p>

<p>Every degree of willingness or resentment in assuming
her share of the burden is met with in the various
girls. Little wisps and snatches of talk are straws that
point to the set of the wind. “Oh, sure, there’s a lot o’
girls that ‘knock down.’ You take this week in our
place,&mdash;we all made good overtime. I know I got two
forty-nine. Well, I guess there wasn’t a single girl but
me that didn’t change her envelope, on our floor.
Whatever you make is written outside in pencil, you
know. That’s easy to fix&mdash;you have only to rub it
out, put on whatever it usually is, and pocket the
change. They think I’m a fool. But I wouldn’t lie
to my mother. She has to work an’ she ain’t had things
none too easy. Some girls are like that. They’re only
too proud to make so much t’ take home.”</p>

<p>A common trick is to pretend to the mother that
wages are smaller than they actually are. Katie at
seventeen was getting $7.50 a week; in six months she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a50">50</span>
had risen from $5.00. This was unusually good for her
set of girls. But her mother believed that she earned
only $6.00.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is the “worrisome” type of
girl who surrenders all. Her unselfishness is as extreme
as the wilfulness of others. She accepts her hard surroundings,
as the others rebel against them, without
counting the cost, and sacrifices unsparingly her
youthful right to gaiety and pleasure. Mamie Reilly’s
mother watched with anxious regret the effect of premature
care and responsibility on her daughter. Mamie
had been working five years since, as a child of thirteen,
she first insisted on getting a job. “She’s a good girl,
Mame is, but y’ never seen anything like her. Every
pay night reg’lar she’ll come in an’ sit down at that
table. ‘Now, Ma,’ she’ll say like that, ‘what <i>are</i> you
goin’ to do? How ever are y’ goin’ t’ make out in th’
rent?’ ‘Land sakes,’ I’ll say, ‘one w’d think this whole
house was right there on your shoulders. I’ll get along
somehow.’ But y’ can’t make her see into that.
‘Now, what’ll we do, how’ll you manage, Ma?’ she’ll
keep askin’. She’s too worrisome&mdash;that’s what I tell
her. An’ she don’t care to go out. Mebbe she’ll take a
walk, but like’s not she’ll say, ‘What’s th’ use?’ Night
after night she jest comes home, eats ’er supper, sits
down, mebbe reads a bit, an’ then goes t’ bed.”</p>

<p>Through everything Mamie had done more than her
share. At eighteen she was tall and awkward, quiet
and shy. Almost alone among these girls, she had
never learned to dance. She had none of the frills&mdash;bangs,
powder, and gewgaws&mdash;the cheap frivolities
which were the joy of the rest. But she had a dignity
and reliability which the other girls respected. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a51">51</span>
whirl of excitement beckoning to the girl in New York,
she had led a staid, colorless life. She had never “gone
out” anywhere because she had never had any clothes.
The price she had given had been the very sap of her
youth. Her mother said, “She is too quiet-like an’
gettin’ humdrum at her age. It ain’t right as I know.”</p>

<p>There is less revolt against these early exactions
among the girls than among the boys. In the midst of
working hours groups of young fellows may be seen any
day of the week idling on the street corners. They are
significant of something badly awry in the social
machinery here. But the girl who refuses to work is
less usual by far. Often the loafer’s sister is going each
day to her job, turning her money in to the common
fund, while he is a parasite who drains the meager
supply. Although she probably protests, it is amazing
to find how often she tolerates a scheme so unfair. One
reason, perhaps, is that a stay-at-home life is too dull
to tempt her into idleness there, and to spend time on
the streets speedily brands her as “tough.” But the
chief reason is that she is ruled by the popular conception
of duty. Inheritance and custom force her to a
conformity which is not required of her brother. Her
protest is fainter than his.</p>

<p>But within the home circle she makes her revolt
felt. Rarely is a girl “worrisome,” like Mamie Reilly;
few girls surrender so much. The trail of her way, a
way glittering with “good times and fun,” carries her
often to the other extreme. She follows the lure of her
desires with an imperious insistence which does not
scruple to shirk the irksome claims of her home. The
result is an atmosphere surcharged with wrangling and
spite. The girl who as a little child may have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a52">52</span>
devoted to her father, now switches away impatiently
under his scolding. He, for his part, complains bitterly
that she thinks only of dancing and new clothes.</p>

<p>One German father whom we knew, at home with his
broken ankle bound in a cast, used his crutch on his
fourteen-year-old daughter. “Don’t tell me about
talkin’ to girls&mdash;I know how to take care o’ them.”
He brandished his weapon with ire. The home was
the scene of quarrels and threats. Amelia was given
the worst of reputations by her parents. She “had
been a disgrace to them.” She stayed out till two in
the morning, hung around halls with boys, and had been
brought home by a policeman. They had tried keeping
her in and putting her under the surveillance of her
nine-year-old brother, but no amount of punishment
would change her fundamentally. Rancor and hatred
had bitten into her soul. She was a strong, tall girl,
loud, unkempt, and disorderly. She was more frank
than most girls, partly from recklessness. But the
bitterness with which she spoke of her parents, the coldness
with which she said, “They can have my money if
that’s what they want,” was that of hardened maturity.</p>

<p>The parents often get a settled distrust of a girl with
which they do not hesitate to confront her. Distrust
is too often justified, for there are few girls who scruple
about telling a lie. But constant accusation and doubt
serve only to deepen suspicion and drive the girl on to
more crafty concealment. The crassness of the punishment
administered is especially bad for her years. To
this can be traced so much of the “wildness” of the
children here. But familiar as she is with brutality
of one kind or another, a special resentment comes to
the girl at this age. Violence outrages her self-respect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a53">53</span>
and the ideals which are struggling for a foothold in her
imagination.</p>

<p>The greatest strain in such households is that between
mother and daughter. The girl is starting her
course, undisciplined and eager. The woman has lived
through checkered and hazardous years. She has suffered
the bearing of many children; she has watched
the death of some. What she has attained has been
hardly won. Through it all, constant labor has drained
her physical strength. She is spent, dragged, and worn,
in pitiful need of the younger, more vigorous life at her
side. As she turns to it there creeps into her attitude
the note of appeal which the girl is too young to appreciate.
If she deals a rebuff with the half conscious
brutality of youth, her mother may draw back into a
shell of hardness. Out of the scant wisdom of her
years the child has been forced to a decision pregnant
with results for her future; for often upon her response
to the older woman’s first appeal trembles her entire
relationship with her mother and her home.</p>

<p>There is no getting away from the girl’s economic
value to her family. It seems ugly and crass that a
child’s contribution to the common purse should have
any bearing on the affection or guidance she will receive.
Yet it has, and her manner of contributing has
even more. Out of the conditions of this engulfing,
material struggle, rise the spiritual forces at work in
each narrow tenement home. Whatever breeds there
of loyalty or bitter estrangement works out its certain
effect. And the spirit of the household is of no greater
import to any member than to the young, venturesome
girl.</p>

<p>Here is a household where the girl’s wages have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a54">54</span>
the mainstay for the whole winter. Louisa’s father, a
German, has always been frugal and hardworking and
was even penurious in better days. He is now seventy-four.
His eyes were weakened in the days of his
strength by the strain of his trade as a tailor. Later
he came to porter’s work, but now he is too feeble for
this. The mother, like so many women in the neighborhood,
earns the rent as a janitress. Louisa’s brother,
a young man of twenty-one, is a glass cutter by trade.
His work might be steady and his wages good, but the
common blight of the West Side has struck him; he
chooses to loaf with the gang and take things easy.
The old father, inveighing against him, has wished to
turn him out. But his mother, although she too takes
her turn at upbraiding, shields him against the others
and clings to a desperate belief in his transparent
excuses.</p>

<p>In this crisis, they have looked to the $5.00 which
Louisa brings home every week from the candy factory.
She is a wilful little person, frail, underdeveloped, weak
of build in character as in physique. The reins have
been put into her hands. She has used her new-found
power to add to her long day at the factory several
nights every week at dance halls where she stays until
1 or 2 o’clock. The reproaches of her parents have
no effect. “You say that you like me,” she wails, “but
you make me miserable here. I’ll go out if I want to,
and I’ll not tell where I am going. Anyhow I don’t
come home drunk like Bill and make a fuss in the hall.
And I work while he hangs around doing nothing.”</p>

<p>Leading the Grand March at the racket of the “Harlem
Four,” Louisa has forgotten her outburst, and the
dull, sad, cramped existence at home. She is thin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a55">55</span>
pale, sharp-featured, yet with a certain daintiness. Her
attire is “flossy” tonight. She cannot boast a ball
dress, to be sure. But her scant suit of brown serge
with its sateen collar is trim and new. It was bought
at an Eighth Avenue store on the instalment plan.
Four out of the twelve dollars have been paid down.
A great encircling hat of cheap black straw reaches to
the middle of her back and bends under the weight of
an enormous “willow.” It sets off her hair, which has
been bleached with peroxide. A long bang hangs to
her eyes. Her moment of elation comes as she receives
the favor for the ladies who lead, a huge bunch of variegated
flowers&mdash;roses, carnations, and daffodils. But
the costume in which she steps out so triumphantly has
cost many bitter moments at home. She has gotten it
by force, with the threat of throwing up her job.</p>

<p>The breach is widening between her and the parents
to whom she clung as a child. There comes the time
when she gets a steady “gentleman friend.” She is out
now almost nightly. At last the mother appears with
her tale, tearful and anxious. “I don’t know whatever
I’m goin’ to do with that girl. I’ve just beat her, I
have&mdash;I guess I ruined three dollars’ worth o’ clothes.
But I lost my temper. She stands up and answers me
back. An’ she’s comin’ in at 2 o’clock, me not
knowin’ where she has been. Folks will talk, you
know, an’ it ain’t right fer a girl.” So Louisa is losing
her only safeguards. Foolish, childish, easily flattered,
she is drifting into a maelstrom of gaiety and pleasure
from which only chance will bring her out unscathed.</p>

<p>The great issue between the home and the girl is the
question as to whether her affections will center there.
Only an emotional hold will take effect on this girl.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a56">56</span>
Her mind is undeveloped. She is not going to reason
far. Habit has not yet fastened her in a rut of eternal
work and decency. Possibilities that menace health
and strength and, in the long run, happiness, hedge
her round. If she becomes estranged from those who
are naturally near to her, she is set adrift. She is
bound to express in some way the chaotic emotional
forces within her. She is dangerous then to herself
and others, in surroundings like these of the far West
Side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a57">57</span></p>

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="large">THE WILL TO PLAY</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A girl</span> from fourteen to eighteen is about as
unstable and kaleidoscopic as any quantity
in nature. She is changing, almost from day
to day. It may be that poverty in her home has deprived
her of her full share of youth’s vigor and supreme
physical wellbeing. Even so, she keeps its impatient
desire for action and experience. She feels its disdain
of restraint and hindrance; its zest for swallowing
life in hot, hasty gulps. The desire to play is strong
in her. Lack-luster resignation and pessimism are
rare among the young even where poverty weighs most
heavily. The girl’s buoyant spirit breaks loose at the
instant of release from factory walls or from the
momentary depression of family want. It bubbles
forth in girls’ laughter and girls’ play, and in girls’
capricious, whimsical, egoistic moods.</p>

<p>The West Side girl is an independent young person.
She has seen a good deal of the world. She has the
early sophistication bred of a crowded, close-pressed
life. As yet, she has not been battered to the wall
in the stress. She has not the pitiful appreciation of the
middle-aged woman for slight and passing kindliness.
She is self-assertive, arrogant, “able to take care of
herself.” She comes, asking nothing, at ease and
alert, but ready to give a trial to anything thrown in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a58">58</span>
her way. If it does not suit, she will not be slow to
reject it. So she stands, looking bright and curious
eyed, straight into the face of her world. She can be
defiant at a hint of challenge. And yet one finds that
she is suddenly and sharply sensitive. Ridicule and
harshness touch her to the quick. Her new-born self-consciousness
is easily wounded. A trifling hurt may
become a lifelong grievance.</p>

<p>This is a signal of a restlessness beneath the surface
which she does not herself understand. It is propelling
her onward in an unconscious search. In all her
pleasure-loving, drifting adventures she is hunting
steadily for the deeper and stronger forces of life. Into
her nature are surging for the first time the insistent
needs and desires of her womanhood. But this she does
not know. She is the daughter of the people, the child
of the masses. Athletics, sports, diversions, the
higher education, will not be hers to divert this deep
craving. She is not close enough to her church for
religion to control it. It will stay with her, sweeping
her inevitably out of the simplicity of little girlhood
into the thousand temptations of her environment,
if not, perhaps, into one of the commonest of neighborhood
tragedies.</p>

<p>Just now her search is translated very lightly and
gaily into the demand for “a good time” and a keen
interest in the other sex. She prosecutes it with the
imperious heedlessness of her age. Her haphazard and
inconsistent training has given her little of the art of
self-control. The city bristles with the chances she
longs for&mdash;“to have fun and see the fellows.” What is
to come of this depends on the unformed character of
the individual girl, the oversight of her family,&mdash;sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a59">59</span>
effective and sometimes not,&mdash;and, most of all,
on chance.</p>

<p>The control of a little money is far more essential to
these girls in their search for enjoyment than to girls
in another class. There are many doors which a very
small coin will open to her. After she goes to work
she usually has a little spending money of her own. As
a rule she is given, besides lunch money and carfare, a
quarter or 50 cents a week. This may go for candy,
carfare to dances and parks, or entrance fees to dance
halls and moving picture shows. Sometimes she spends
the money given her for carfare on other and more
pleasurable things, and walks to work, “wearing out
shoe leather, which ain’t right,” as her mother complains.
A carfare saved by walking to work is a carfare
earned for a trip to a dance hall “away out in the
Bronx.” Usually a single fare is enough for the whole
trip. The “fellow” who “sees you home” will pay for
the return. Thus the little West Sider makes her 25
cents carry her as far along the primrose path as possible.</p>

<p>She has no keener longing than her longing for pretty
and becoming clothes. Usually she helps in selection,
though now and then the mother buys her clothing from
the girl’s own earnings as autocratically as she buys
the rest of the home necessities. Sometimes the girl is
allowed to keep a dollar or two out of her pay every week
with which she buys her own clothes. Often there
comes a period of distress which swallows up her whole
wages week after week. She sees her earnings go for
rent, for fuel, and for food. Hers is not the time of life
to be content with shelter, warmth, and nourishment.
She would rather starve for these things than miss
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a60">60</span>
her worshipped pleasures. Mamie Craven, working
steadily in the laundry, turning in her money every
Saturday night, once broke out one night in a bitter
wail, “Oh, Miss Wright, you don’t know <i>how</i> I want
a chinchilla coat.”</p>

<p>There are bound to be many lacks in her wardrobe.
Usually the greatest one is that of protective clothing.
She has no overshoes and no umbrella. When it rains
she comes drenched to her club, but will not think of
foregoing the evening’s pleasure on that account. She
goes to work in the same unprotected fashion. Winter
clothes are thin and inadequate. Many a girl’s vitality
is sapped for months in the year through sheer
exposure to cold. These deficiencies are endured uncomplainingly.
It is much harder if finery or the
coveted Easter suit must be foregone. The poorer girl
will buy her suit on the instalment plan&mdash;$4.00 down
and $2.00 each following week. She pays $15 for a suit
of the value of $10. She is often guilty, like girls of
every class, of some wild bit of extravagance. But in
her case extravagance may become heartlessness. A
girl whose income was the only regular support of her
family spent $5.00&mdash;a week’s wages&mdash;on a willow plume.
“We starved fer that hat,” her mother said, “just plain
starved fer it, so we did.”</p>

<p>Social relations between girls of their age and
class are very unlike those of boys. A single friend
or a little clique takes the place of the gang.
They will follow a leader for a moment but not
consistently; they are jealous of leadership and slow
to acknowledge it. There is almost no natural
loyalty to a group. Probably the girl by the time
she reaches fourteen has already some special companion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a61">61</span>
This may be a playmate from her school
days, or, very likely, a “pick up” on the street or
at work, who soon has the title of “me lady friend.”
The relationship may extend over years. It is very
constant and means that the two share most of their
pleasures together. There are distinct requirements;
one must “call up” and “wait in” and not “go round”
too much with anyone else. But the girl is rare who
has a strong feeling of obligation toward appointments
or promises. Therefore the friendship is sure to be
checkered by quarrels and reunions. There are besides
a thousand and one reasons for dispute. The quarrel
is taken very seriously, but the chances are that the
breach will heal before long. However, this is not
always so; no prediction formed on girl nature is sure.
The relationship assumes at times some of the formality
and ceremony of the gang. In one case, a definite
proposal to be “friends” was made by a girl who had
quarreled with her former lady friend. The second girl
declined, not from any dislike, but because she was
already “going with somebody else.” When a girl
begins to have a “gentleman friend” even the slight
ceremony of calling up and waiting in for the girl friend
is omitted.</p>

<p>The cliques consist of three or four girls, seldom of
more. They are likely to exist among the younger
girls who have played together as children. They are
seldom formed later on, but incline to resolve themselves
into the standard couples.</p>

<p>The girls’ homes are not very advantageous places
for entertainment and fun. They are too cramped and
often too forlorn. Yet everyone here is used to these
conditions, and they are not the only difficulties which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a62">62</span>
stand in the way of visits and hospitality. Visits from
gentlemen friends are frowned upon and not desired.
The parents, especially of the younger girls, look askance
on the boys who come to see them.</p>

<p>“My father was always too strict with us girls,” said
an older sister, married and established in her own home.
“It was always work and keep quiet at home the minute
we came in from the factory. He believed that girls
must be kept down. He’d have beaten us good if we’d
brought a fellow home. So I used to meet my friend
at a corner a few blocks off, just the same as my sister
Maggie has been doing. It’s only a wonder I didn’t
get into trouble the same as she has done and get put
away like her. I’m not the one to turn against her
now. When she comes out of the Home, she and her
baby can come and live with me.”</p>

<p>The sequel of Maggie’s story only served to prove
the unwisdom of the parental policy which had tried to
“keep her down.” One day Maggie returned to her
sister’s home with her six-months-old baby. A week
later her sister announced with the utmost gratification
and relief that Maggie was married. “If she’d only
told us at the start, there’d never been any need for all
this trouble. Hannick is a decent fellow and has steady
work. He was looking for Maggie all the time she was
in the hospital and he was afraid to ask her folks what
had become of her. As soon as she came back here, he
sent word to me and asked if he could see her. That
was the first time I knew who her fellow was. When
he came around I told them they ought to go straight
off to the priest, and they did.”</p>

<p>The street corner has become, with its free and easy
etiquette, a substitute for the home. It is very popular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a63">63</span>
in spite of nagging from the “cop.” Still, the policeman
is not a very censorious chaperon. Even the older
girl whose parents have opened their door to her company
has often learned to prefer its lack of supervision.
As a place of rendezvous it is greatly preferred to a
parlor of one’s own where one must be “real lady-like.”
“You see,” one of the girls explained, “my friend comes
to my home; then if he wants me to go somewhere to a
dance, my mother’ll likely hear and won’t let me. My
brother knows all the places and he’ll tell my mother
there’s likely to be shooting there. He makes it bad
for me that way.”</p>

<p>The boys’ preference for the street corner is quite as
strong as the girls’. Their habit is to send a small boy
as intermediary to the girl’s door to tell her who is waiting
in the hall below. An incident at “471” gave the
smaller boys a chance to express their sentiment. Their
gang, known in the neighborhood as “tough young
nuts,” were giving a return party to their girl friends.
It was to be a “swell” affair, and had involved much
consultation and collecting of money beforehand. The
instructions had been, “Buy three times as much ice
cream as the girls had at their party. Get a cake as
big as the cover of this table (a centerpiece 22 inches
round). Get three pounds of good candy. Get all the
milk and cocoa you want for them girls, but none of
that for us. We want soda and ginger ale and celery
tonic.” These concoctions, not as harmless as their
names suggest, had been purchased by the boys.
Everything was elaborately ready and the party had
begun. All the guests had arrived except the special
friends of two of the boys. A club leader’s naïve suggestion
was that Peter and “Gimp” should call for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a64">64</span>
girls at their homes. Gimp leaned forward, astonished,
as if uncertain of what he had heard. “Homes,” he
gasped, in a tone surcharged with dismay. “Gee,” the
other boy added, “that sure w’d be some place to go,
a’right.”</p>

<p>Still, the home is by no means to be discounted entirely
as a place for recreation. There is too much
Irish jollity and good-fellowship in our neighborhood
to make it altogether a tame and stupid place. The
“house party,” as any home gathering is known, is not
unusual. Music, dancing, and drinking are the chief
features of the entertainment on such occasions. A
Thanksgiving party at the McKeevers’, for instance,
to which the family invited one of the club leaders,
showed that the happy good-fellowship which Goldsmith
mourned as forever departed from the “Deserted
Village” has crossed the ocean with the Irish immigrants
and is still preserved to some extent in their
newer stronghold on the Middle West Side.</p>

<p>The homelike spirit of the gathering was noticeable.
Mrs. McKeever, gray-haired, fifty-two years of age,
presided over the festivities. She sat in the only rocking
chair, holding in her arms the small son of a neighbor,
aged three, extremely dirty and ragged, and as a companion
a fox terrier, the pet of the McCormick family.
Then came Mrs. O’Hara, the neighbor from the next
tenement, large and fat and slovenly, but perfectly
good-natured and kindly. She was nursing a small child
who was boarded with her by some organization. The
child was sleepy and tired and whenever he dozed off
was wakened by the music and dancing. In the corner
of the sofa next to Mrs. O’Hara was a small, undeveloped
specimen of humanity in a faded flannellette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a65">65</span>
dress and very much broken shoes whose appearance
classed her as degenerate. She was also a neighbor
and had come in to take part in the Thanksgiving
festivities. On the same sofa with her at the other end
sat a well made-up Negro minstrel, with feet crossed
and a large guitar in his arms, who played and sang as
well as many a man in a minstrel show on the stage.
Next to him, on a kitchen chair, sat a chap of probably
thirty-five years. A crutch stood beside his chair, and
upon a closer look one could see that one of his legs
had been amputated. He was very dreamily playing
an accordion, and had had just enough drink to make
him very solemn and uninterested in people and
things in general. Mrs. McKeever several times deposited
the small child and the fox terrier in the middle
of the floor and went over to remonstrate with him
for not being willing to take part in the ceremonies.
He, however, could not be persuaded and sat perfectly
still, only occasionally extracting a glass of beer from
under his chair and offering it to the others. Over
in the corner next to the man with the accordion was
a short, stout boy, probably of seventeen years, in his
shirt sleeves, whose chief desire was to dance, but who
found it difficult to procure partners.</p>

<p>These were the guests on one side of the room. In
front of the large pier glass at the end the chair was
occupied by an immense Teddy bear, who occasionally
was forced into taking part in the dances and general
merrymaking. The next seat was occupied by Delia
McKeever. Delia was a remarkably good-looking
girl, and on most occasions was neat and tidy, but this
evening she was conspicuous because of her untidiness.
She had had enough beer to make her unusually mirthful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a66">66</span>
and to make her dance much better than usual. Next
to Delia sat Annie, also in most untidy condition.
Lizzie, the youngest daughter, was sent for to come in
from the street. She was dressed in boy’s clothes
and had been out masquerading. Holding the center
of the floor was a rather handsome chap who
played the mandolin well and had a bellowing baritone
voice.</p>

<p>The McKeever family were very solicitous that their
guests should have a good time, and went around
whispering to the musicians, telling them to play or
sing whatever the visitors suggested. Everyone sang
“The Suwanee River,” and the players of the mandolin
and accordion sang several of the latest popular songs.
Delia and Annie did a fancy dance known as the
“Novelty.” Delia also danced with the chap in the
corner, who was ever busy trying to procure a partner.
He was so much shorter than Delia that she could
conveniently rest her forehead on his head, which she
did during the entire dance, making him act very much
as a prop to her wilful, antic steps.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are two places in which the unoccupied of all
ages and types may be seen&mdash;the streets and the moving
picture shows. Eighth Avenue, the residence street
of our aristocracy, is the promenade of the district.
No one has better expressed the essential spirit of
these promenades than Mr. Wells has done in The New
Machiavelli.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>“Unkindly critics, blind to the inner meanings of
things, call them, I believe, Monkey’s Parades&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a67">67</span>
shop apprentices, the young work girls, the boy clerks,
and so forth, stirred by mysterious intimations, spend
their first-earned money upon collars and ties, chiffon
hats, smart lace collars, walking-sticks, sunshades, or
cigarettes, and come valiantly into the vague transfiguring
mingling of gas light and evening, to walk up
and down, to eye meaningly, even to accost and make
friends. It is a queer instinctive revolt from the narrow,
limited, friendless homes in which so many find
themselves, a going out toward something, romance, if
you will, beauty, that has suddenly become a need&mdash;a
need that hitherto has lain dormant and unsuspected.
They promenade. Vulgar!&mdash;it is as vulgar
as the spirit that calls the moth abroad in the evening
and lights the body of the glow-worm in the
night.”</p>

<p>Here also are the flashing, gaudy, poster-lined
entrances of Hickman’s and of the Galaxy. These
supply the girls with a “craze,” the same that sends
those with a more liberal allowance to the matinees.
Their pictures spread out adventure and melodrama
which are soul-satisfying. The vaudeville is even more
popular and not so clean.</p>

<p>Sooner or later almost every girl drifts into some
club or settlement. She is a wandering spirit, difficult
to hold, still more difficult to tie down to any definite
program. She wants activity but soon tires of any
one form of it. She cannot concentrate, especially on
any finely co-ordinated work requiring time and
patience. Dancing and music make the strongest
appeal to her. A boisterous club room will quiet suddenly
to the sound of “Oh! Mr. Dream Man, let me
dream some more.” The dark-eyed girl at the piano
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a68">68</span>
drawls in shrill nasal mimicry of the vaudeville “artist,”
copying her air and mannerisms.</p>

<p>Cheap and shoddy&mdash;but the scene typifies that
groping for the ideal which is universal. Look along
the line of faces, stilled and attentive. Something is
there neither cheap nor small. Here the face of a
youngster is caught an instant from its impish drollery.
The hardening lines are soft as with a child’s wonder at
something beautiful and new. Next to her an older girl
is leaning forward. Her features are haggard and
drawn, a ghastly white. But she sits with opened lips
and a look in her eyes as if she heard beyond the singing
something half articulate and far-away. The song
has brought a quickening of the imagination, a stirring
of childish, unformed aspirations, half gropings for a
world finer than the one she knows.</p>

<p>In these girls the longing for the unreal is overlaid by
much that is commonplace and sordid. To come upon
this sudden, vivid glimpse of it takes away one’s
breath. At the same instant some of the faces are
prophetic of its final dying out. The girls’ instinctive
idealism, a wild thing here, unnurtured, is as elusive
and fleeting as it is beautiful. It is foredoomed to
fade swiftly in the midst of unfriendly reality.</p>

<p>Only a fleeting glimpse of the ideal, and soon the club
room is again a clamorous, gay, turbulent place. There
is much energy that must be let off; nothing but dancing
will satisfy the demand. This means that the
doors must be opened to “the fellows” too. They,
meantime, have been besieging the club from the outside.
If the older girl is to be held, some concession
must be made to her chief desire. Once it is made, many
difficulties arise. The interest between the girls and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a69">69</span>
boys here is almost wholly one of sex. They are farther
apart than in other circles. As children, there has been
very little playing in common. The boys’ interests are
more energetic; group athletics have seldom been opened
to the girls of the elementary schools. Both boys and
girls have a narrow range of knowledge and impersonal
interests. Conversation is a mere exchange of personalities,
gossip, and bickering, and there is little even of
that. The girls line up on one side of the room; the boys
group together on the other side. Games are sidetracked
as foolish. There is only dancing to bring them together,
and so the club dances. This is doubtless the
reason why the dance hall holds the first place in the
girl’s estimation of a good time. In these places she
learns the “tough” dances in their worst forms and with
all their suggestive details. If she attends these dubious
resorts freely, she is marked socially by it.</p>

<p>Most of the girls under sixteen and the most strictly
guarded of the older girls go to dances only occasionally.
Then they attend some “racket” given by their special
friends, their fathers’ association, or their church.
They may go with their families or be taken by a boy
friend with their parents’ knowledge and consent.
Perhaps a younger sister is allowed to go along, much
below the age when the first daughter started, because
“she’s company for May.” This occasional ball, with
its more or less formal invitation, its sanction by the
parents, and its semi-chaperonage, is considered a very
different thing from the promiscuous attendance of
dance halls.</p>

<p>Many of the older girls, as we have seen, go much as
they choose, in a free and easy fashion. They are
not restricted, or if they are they “sneak” away.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a70">70</span>
Two girls go together as a rule. They must have a
little money&mdash;carfare and a quarter for entrance.
But that is all that is needed; no chaperon and no
escort. Bonds are off; freedom is absolute; the range
of possibilities is almost limitless. From Fourteenth
Street to 162nd Street, East Side and West, from
Coney to Jersey, these eager feet in the path of pleasure
find their way. They are not even dependent on
the initiative of an escort for their good time. The
girls decide on their dance hall, and once on the floor,
a “pick-up” is easy to acquire. If they dance together,
two men are sure to “break” provided the girls
are good looking and dance well. Etiquette demands
that they remain through the dance with this random
partner. To desert him on the floor is an insult which
he may avenge with violence. To sneak between the
halves is somewhat risky and is considered mean. It
is better, as one of our girls pointed out, to tell him
frankly that “you can’t seem to keep step and you’d
rather not dance it out.”</p>

<p>The dance hall, with its air of license, its dark corners
and balconies, its tough dancing, and its heavy drinking,
is becoming familiar to every reader of the newspapers.
To the girls who attend them they are not all of one
kind by any means. The best places are perhaps too
“classy” for the West Side girl, and she has not the
proper clothes. The character of the dances at any hall
depends, our informants said, entirely upon the club
that manages the affair. “If they don’t want nothing
but society dancing, why the cop’ll keep the floor clear
for them. But if some of these tough fellows are running
the racket off they go to the cop and say, ‘We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a71">71</span>
don’t want any dancing stopped here. See?’ and he
leaves them alone.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Home-going is not thought of
until 1 or 2, often 3 or 4 a. m. The ball is often followed
by a trip to a restaurant and home is finally
reached at 6 a. m.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a72">72</span></p>

<p>A party of this kind is not the single carnival of the
year. Once a week, if not twice or thrice, the girl who
goes to the dance hall goes through its round of excesses.
The most startling fact in this connection is that it is
the little girls who are doing the dancing in the public
places of amusement in New York. The young girl
usually settles down to keeping steady company some
time before her early marriage, and goes less to the
dance halls. Sixteen-year-old Josie, spending three
out of every seven nights of the week at public dances,
said, “When I’m eighteen or nineteen I won’t care about
it any more. I’ll have a ‘friend’ then and won’t want
to go anywheres.”</p>

<p>There is another group of girls who do not go to the
dance halls. They have not even the small amount of
money that would take them there, nor the one suit of
good clothes that would make them presentable among
the others. Lacking the tawdry finery and the superficial
good manners of the other set, they are shabby
and dirty and are known throughout the block as tough.
Between them and the upper set, those who hover on
the edge of toughness and fight for the poor distinction
of just escaping it, there is a chasm of dislike, suspicion,
and jealousy. The tough girls have the two universal
amusement places&mdash;the street and the nickel “dump”
(moving picture show). Besides these, they can make
meeting places of the alleys, the docks, and vacant
rooms in the tenements. These neglected, unlit cracks
and crannies serve as traps for childhood of both sexes.
Here children are snared in the darkness long before
they are old enough to know the meaning of temptation.
This is the most sinister phase of the recreation
problem.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a73">73</span></p>

<p>Marriage is for all these girls the final and greatest
adventure of adolescence. They do not look past the
adventure at the responsibilities which lie beyond. The
question of children is waved aside as scarcely worth a
hearing. Here, where the management of a household
is so hazardous and stern an affair, it is most lightly
assumed. The girl steps carelessly and boldly ahead.
Sixteen is a bit early, but eighteen or nineteen is a good
age and further delay is considered needless.</p>

<p>Sometimes the girl goes to church with her companion
and is married in the presence of her family and
friends. But very often she and her boy-husband indulge
in a mild elopement. This is not necessarily done
to evade the objection of parents. It is partly in obedience
to the romantic instinct of youth and partly because
the girl and her family cannot afford the parade
of a real wedding. After one of these secret marriages,
it is not uncommon for the girl to go on living at home
and working, while her husband does the same. In a
short time the fact of their marriage becomes known;
the young pair become the center of neighborhood interest;
and then, as a decidedly secondary matter, the
question of their “taking up rooms” is considered.
Probably the new wife goes on working in order to buy
furniture for her home.</p>

<p>“What do you think!” exclaimed Mrs. Attinger to
a visitor from the club who dropped in on a Saturday
morning. “Our Lizzie’s married. She’s been married
two months and they never told me till last week.”
Mrs. Attinger seemed not at all displeased with the
event, viewing it as a successful joke on herself and
Lizzie’s friends. She went on to relate how her daughter
had given up her job at the cigarette factory and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a74">74</span>
had gone over to live in New Jersey with her husband,
who was a day laborer. It also appeared, from her
mother’s story, that the young couple had not started
out under the most favorable auspices. Lizzie had
visited Mrs. Attinger the day before with the news
that her husband expected to be laid off soon and she
was looking for work, as she needed money to furnish
her house. Mrs. Attinger related these details without
seeming to be particularly disturbed by them.</p>

<p>It was, after all, the familiar story of beginning wives
and husbands on the West Side. It indicated that
Lizzie had quickly found marriage to be an extremely
sobering event. Henceforth she would have new problems
to face, problems in which the adolescent hunger
for good times would cease to be the dominant element.
The will to play was to give place to the incessant
struggle for existence which makes up the career of the
wife of a casual laborer.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="large">THE BREAKDOWN OF FAMILY PROTECTION</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Our</span> West Side girls were members of a supposedly
protected part of the community.
Each of them belonged to a family group;
if they were not living with their own parents, near
relatives had taken them in. Their homes were in a
section which possesses a neighborhood life and neighborhood
opinions. The population is far more stable
than that of the East Side; recent comers are rare.
Some of our girls told of how their mothers had gone to
school together. One had started in the same school
through which her mother had passed. Many families
had shifted around within a range of 10 blocks for a
generation. The parents of most of them had been
here from ten to thirty or forty years. It is, then, not
in the absence but in the breakdown of neighborhood
and family protection that we must seek the reasons for
social, moral, and physical deterioration in these girls.</p>

<p>The character of the community goes far to counter-balance
any advantage the girl may gain from living in
an environment familiar to herself and to her parents.
If she grows up in one of these blocks, she is, from babyhood,
in the midst of lawlessness and rumors of lawlessness.
They are afloat in the air she breathes, as
certain to be inhaled as are the heavy odors from the
gas plants and slaughter pens.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a76">76</span></p>

<p>Two girls came excitedly into their club with news of
an assault which had just taken place down the block.
They had loitered to join the curious crowd and to have a
look at the victim. They related the details of the event
and commented upon them as upon a familiar story.</p>

<p>There was a ripple of excitement, but no surprise.
One girl exclaimed, “Things like that are happening
on our block all the time.”</p>

<p>The block where this girl lived bears the distinction
of having sheltered, some forty years ago, the original
“Hell’s Kitchen” gang.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> A junk-covered lot is pointed
out as the site of the tumble-down shack where the
gang met. The shack has disappeared, while in the
rear, facing the street to the north, a mission is now in
full swing. Still, tradition upholds the desperate character
of the locality and gives it a bad reputation. The
police declare, however, that it is no worse than many
other parts of the neighborhood. Fifteen of our club
girls came from this block. All the toughs who gather
there are, of course, identified with the “Gopher Gang.”
The Gophers were said to have assaulted the housekeeper
in 562. She had reported to the police their
use of her vacant rooms, and in revenge they had
“beaten her up.” It was to this same house, which
bears a bad reputation, that a physician had been
recently called, late in the evening, to attend a baby.
The child was in convulsions, the effect of the whiskey
with which she had been “doped.” After a search
through the house, he found only one family sober
enough to be trusted with the child.</p>

<p>Authentic stories of violence came to us from time to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a77">77</span>
time. Many other tales were the product of gossip
largely mingled with falsehood. But the brutality of
the neighborhood speaks for itself; it is everywhere,
in the streets, in the talk, in the minds of old and young.
Recklessness and daring are apt to be painted with
heightened colors, exaggerated beyond the fact. The
child does not discriminate between garbled truth
and falsity. In any case, these stories take effect
on her. They are poured into her mind and muddy the
stream of her imagination. She believes a large amount
of what comes to her ears, some of which she sees and
knows to be true. The girls who lived in this block,
though they were coming and going by night and day,
had yet a lively apprehension of its dangers. “When
I go home after ten,” said Mamie Stertle, “I always
get the cop on the corner to see me to my door.”
Mamie had lived uptown for a few months. Up there,
far to the north, she had acquired a friend of a superior
type, a chauffeur, who worked steadily and always had
money in his pocket. When she came back to live on
the West Side, she took it for granted that he could not
come to her home, lest he be assaulted and robbed.</p>

<p>The young girl shares in all the gossip of her elders.
She takes in greedily the idle talk of the kitchen, the
stoop, and the street. In this prurient school she becomes
familiar, even as a child, with the lowest forms
of vice and immorality. Living on the same block with
15 of our girls were two young women who were the
“talk of the parish.” “They begun in the dance halls
back o’ the saloons,” said Mrs. Ryan, “and look what
they are now!” Not one of our 15 girls but was
familiar with the talk and with all the details of the
two irregular lives about which it centered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a78">78</span></p>

<p>A restaurant was opened on the corner. It was soon
noised about that the woman proprietor was identical
with a notorious criminal who had served a sentence
of twenty years for infanticide. Before long the girls
were repeating with gusto horrible stories of her crimes.
Sadie Toohey, standing on the corner with a group of
schoolmates, informed them concerning the restaurant
keeper, “She was a midwife and used to burn babies.”
Then, with a toss of her blonde head with its little-girl
bows, she added, “She burned one of mine.” The sally
was greeted with shouts of appreciation and Sadie’s reputation
as a wit rose among her comrades.</p>

<p>A mother, even one of the wisest, finds it no easy task
to defend her young against these influences. Life is
far too congested in such quarters for the girl to escape
any of its aspects. When a family of from six to eight
members lives in three or four rooms it is impossible to
segregate the young from their elders. Only well-to-do
parents can afford to provide a separate life tempered to
the needs of young and growing personalities. The
poor man’s house has no nursery for its young, no annex
like the boarding school, which enlarges the dimensions
of the rich man’s house and provides a special environment
friendly to youth and its needs. The daughter
of fourteen in the tenements must share the experience
of the mother of fifty, who, even with the best intentions,
cannot shield her girl from her own fifty-year-old
materialistic morals. What is true of the individual
family is also true of mass life on the block. There is
no segregation of youth. The result is precocious
hardness or youthful rebellion.</p>

<p>If the practice of pooling the moral standards of old
and young is not considered ideal training for children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a79">79</span>
in families whose moral standards meet the usual requirements,
it is even less desirable in families which
are either degraded or undeveloped. There are here
on the West Side many families who have the naïve
morality of primitive social groups. The result is
that many of the girls are simply reared in a different
morality from that of the community at large.
Illegitimate births are common. Marriage&mdash;even a
common law marriage&mdash;is accepted as removing any
stigma that might attach to an irregular relationship.
“Oh, it is all right,” said the parents of one girl-mother,
“because she’s been goin’ with Bill now for years.
They’ll marry as soon as they can.”</p>

<p>One of our club girls drifted into a temporary union
and then drifted out again in the most matter-of-fact
way. After a period of absence from the club, she
was reported upon inquiry to be married. “She done
well for herself,” rumor ran. One day she turned up
at the club and brought her boy-husband, apparently
a decent, steady sort of chap. Soon we learned that
they had not really been married but had started the
report in a spirit of fun. However, they now decided
to go through the ceremony in earnest and together
they went to the priest. Here they met an unexpected
obstacle, for their visit had been forestalled by
Mattie’s mother, who did not approve of Cleary for
a son-in-law and had charged the priest not to marry
them. The girl returned home, but continued to meet
Cleary on the street and to go around with him. Then
gradually she began to shake off the connection,
breaking promises to the boy and failing to keep appointments
with him. He came to the club one evening
expecting to find her there according to her promise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a80">80</span>
But Mattie did not come to the club that night, and
Cleary, after waiting a while in vain, departed saying
darkly, “That’s the third time this week she’s give me
the hang-up.” There was evidence that Mattie’s
mother was more concerned about the loss of her
daughter’s earnings than about making her an “honest”
girl.</p>

<p>The toleration of moral irregularities is mingled with
much harshness of censure. “D’ ye know Jennie
Meehan that lives in th’ house next to ours?” Kitty
Stevens asks the cooking class. “Well, she’s just had
a baby. Father McGratty went there today an’ he
married her an’ the feller. Her sister was just th’
same way, only she went and had her baby in Jersey.
Me mother says if she had that kind of girl she’d burn
her, she w’d. Burnin’ w’d be good enough for the
likes o’ her.” But in spite of this severity of comment,
the occurrence is accepted philosophically by
the elders of the neighborhood, and soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Some families fall below all moral codes, even
the simple ethics of the far West Side. The fault
which may be forgiven in the girl is not so pardonable
in her parents. Open and excessive infidelity
on the part of the father and drink or infidelity
on the part of the mother may make the family outcasts
from among the merely poor. The daughter
shares the degradation of the others and can scarcely
escape the consequences. Even where the habits of
her elders are not the subject of gossip, she herself
cannot escape the knowledge and the influence. There
was fifteen-year-old Addie Mercer, bright, vivacious,
with sparkling dark eyes, who was getting a “bad
name.” The unsavory example came from her father.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a81">81</span>
He, as Addie and her mother and all the children knew,
maintained a second household with a colored woman
in charge. The effects of this constant example, as
well as of other demoralizing influences, were already
evident in Addie, and the final result threatened to be
total moral collapse.</p>

<p>Often the mere physical conditions of life seem
enough to account for the moral tragedies. The hallways
of these tenements are perennially dark by day,
although they are lit by flickering gas jets in the evening.
The legal requirements for illumination of dark
halls and stairs are too often evaded throughout the
tenements. There was one house in our neighborhood
where no lights burned in any of the halls day or
night, for months. It is not uncommon to find a hall so
pitch-dark that one must feel one’s way down the stairs.</p>

<p>A white flower was sent to the sick mother of one
of our girls. When a visitor called, it was literally
the only thing that could be seen in the woman’s
room. All other details&mdash;walls, bed clothing, the
features of the sick woman&mdash;were lost in blackness
until the eyes of the visitor became sufficiently accustomed
to the darkness to distinguish between them.
Men boarders shared from time to time the three
rooms of this home. In this flat and others like it
a daughter had lived her fourteen years. Then, still
a child, she became a mother.</p>

<p>Childhood in the tenements cannot escape the
smirch of its brutal and ugly surroundings. The open
toilet where little children play has given occasion to
the bitterest of tragedies. The corner saloon, without
which no block is complete, is always, it must be remembered,
a part of some tenement house. It impinges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a82">82</span>
on the homes of 12 or 15 families. The halls
reek with the odor of bad whiskey. Snatches of
saloon talk and saloon laughter leak through the walls,
even by day. Out of homes like this come girls and
boys to go to schools from whose neighborhood all
liquor selling is legally banished to a distance of at
least 200 yards! Truly, our legal protection of childhood
is in some respects a farce.</p>

<p>Allowing for great deficiencies, we have still much
natural vigor and strength among the young in the
district. This is not yet a spot such as some that
exist in the London slums, pervaded with the taint of
innate mental and physical degeneration. The parents
of our girls were mainly Irish immigrants or first generation
Irish-Americans. They came of vigorous
peasant stock, and from a country which is, by comparison
with the rest of Europe, almost free from
venereal disease. We found that most of our club
girls had a fair physical inheritance. Of a group of
20 who were given physical examinations, 18 were
shown to have well-developed muscles and organs.
Notwithstanding many signs of weariness and disease,
they were not lacking in stamina. All the more for
this reason should the girl in her adolescent years live
under a régime which will conserve her natural energy.
The chance for health and strength should not be
thrown away. These are the years of nervous instability
in which especially she needs rest, change, exercise, and
the healthful freedom of outdoor play and occupation.
Her chances for all these things are very limited.
Bodies intended to be vigorous are hard used from the
start, and during adolescence they are often strained
and harried far beyond their recuperative power.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a83">83</span></p>

<p>Almost every night some girl came dragging in
with heavy eyes and cheeks dead white under the
powder. There were complaints galore of weariness
and headache. One great reason was the immoderate
pace at which the lives of such girls are hurried on.
Long hours of work are thrust upon them. Long hours
of play are seized with petulant insistence. To wrap
packages from 7 a. m. until 5:30 p. m. within the walls
of a factory; then several times a week to dance until
2 or 3 a. m. in the stifling closeness, the noise and excitement
of a public hall, is a not unusual program. The
immature body is bound to fail. With the girl who
keeps up her train of pleasures, only a rebellious season
now and then, when she loafs and sleeps long mornings,
saves her from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Another cause of discomfort and pain, often with
serious results, is the prevalence of minor defects of
body. They have gone without care for months and
years. Practically no girl has had teeth, eyes, and
throat kept in good condition. The group of 20 girls
were examined for defect in scalp, nose, ears, throat,
teeth, eyes, heart, and lungs. Not one examined was
without defect. Of the 20, 15 had enlarged tonsils
and five had adenoids; 12 had defective teeth; four
defective vision; two were cross-eyed; three had
spinal curvature; one had trachoma; and one conjunctivitis.</p>

<p>Two sisters brought trachoma to the house from an
institution where they had been reared. Sarah had
been cured by a delicate and skilful operation. Martha
had been discharged without any treatment. She
was one of the toughest girls in the club and least concerned
about herself or her appearance. When she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a84">84</span>
came to us she was “bumming,” without a job. In
her torn and filthy clothing, with reddened eyes half
closed with the disease, she looked the most forlorn
and neglected of the underworld. For weeks we
worked to induce her mother to give her care. “Thank
God, there’s nothing much the matter with her eyes,”
was the mother’s final answer after she had been
warned that blindness was a certain consequence.
And from her sister, Sarah’s eyes were re-infected.
A case recorded in the group of 20 was also contracted
from her.</p>

<p>These examinations were little guide to the most
serious physical defects among the girls. Those most
in need of care were most difficult and wayward about
examination. The mention of a doctor dismayed
them. Some who promised to go never reached his
office. But a weekly clinic was continued through
the winter. Gradually the girls gained confidence
and a number of serious troubles came to light. Three
cases of tuberculosis&mdash;two incipient&mdash;were found. The
third, which was taking a headlong course, was checked
and ultimately cured by sending the girl daily to a
hospital boat. Two girls were finally examined and
treated for venereal disease. It was noticeable that
girls whose histories and habits left little doubt of
sexual abuse were under par in general health. Undoubtedly
this operated both as cause and as result.</p>

<p>Carrie Fuller drifted into the club irregularly for
months. Her voice, her frown, her dragging slouch
across the room all told of the absence of any stamina.
She never consented to any suggestion of a doctor or
of care. It is inevitable that such a condition should
make continuous work impossible. She was in a cigarette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a85">85</span>
factory till she “chucked her job.” When we saw
her after several weeks of absence, we learned without
surprise that she had left home to live with a married
sister and “lead a sporting life.” She laughed a bit
recklessly and shambled out, leaving only the wonder
that she cared to come at all. Without bodily vitality,
how shall any of these children live through the
long working days of their youth? And, still more,
how shall they resist the continual pressure of the
viciousness around them? Yet many a girl is scattering
to the wind the strength of her youth.</p>

<p>A group composed of 19 of our girls, ranging in age
from thirteen to seventeen, were examined in a psychological
clinic. Four girls stood above the normal
in mental ability, 10 were normal, and two were barely
normal. One was below normal, as the result of
immoral habits, and two were feeble-minded.</p>

<p>In the full story, broken schooling, low moral standards,
the brutal life of the streets, low housing, and
physical inferiority all play their part in the coarsened
moral outlook of the girls. There is a group demoralized
even in childhood by the abuse of their sexual
functions. There are some who fall into immorality
during the first years of adolescence. For the most
part, however, the girls finally slip into the established
ways of marriage and family building. From
such groups the children of the next generation will
be born in the largest proportion. To society, as well
as themselves, it matters a great deal whether they
have been crippled in mind and body by a wretched
and brutal environment.</p>

<p>Such a girl was May Carney, who announced one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a86">86</span>
day to our consternation that she was going to be married.
May was only sixteen and a victim of gonorrhea.
She had been, however, perfectly “straight” for a
couple of years. At the age of sixteen she looked upon
herself as a reformed character. “I used to be pretty
tough with the boys,” she said. “That’s a pretty bad
thing for any girl to say of herself, but I’m over it now.”
The physician had said that it would require three
years to cure her thoroughly of her disease and had
recommended a slight operation immediately. In view
of these facts, we could only feel great concern at the
news of her immediate marriage. One of the club
leaders sought out her mother to remonstrate against
the marriage and also to propose that May should go
to the hospital for two weeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carney was found at home one evening about
8 o’clock, and adjourned with her visitor to the hall
outside for a confidential talk. The public passage,
lighted by a flaring gas jet, was surrounded by four
closed doors shutting off as many different flats and
the crowded domestic life within. In the evening,
when Mrs. Carney’s family was at home, it was the
only spot where she could have a private word with
a caller. Her final summing up of her daughter’s situation
was this: “You see, if May was to go away to the
hospital for two weeks, they’d all say she went away to
have a baby. You see them two doors,” pointing to
the forward end of the hall. “The girls in there&mdash;both
of them&mdash;have just been away havin’ babies.
They didn’t have nobody to take care of them, so they
had to bring their babies home. Now, if May was to
be gone two weeks, ye couldn’t make nobody believe
she wasn’t doin’ just the same as them two.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a87">87</span></p>

<p>In view of this difficulty it was suggested that the
operation might be performed at home. This seemed
feasible, and the more serious question of May’s marriage
was then broached. “Yes, May will be married
in September,” said Mrs. Carney. “I know, she’s not
seventeen yet, but it’s this way, y’ see. She’s sickly,
she won’t never be no good to me,&mdash;the two or three
dollars she brings home won’t hardly keep her,&mdash;and
she’s always wantin’ money to spend on herself. What
I say is, she’d better get married now. Daley is a good
fellow and he’s workin’ steady. She mightn’t have so
good a chance again.”</p>

<p>It would not be fair to blame Mrs. Carney very
harshly for the materialism of this speech and her total
lack of consideration for the “steady fellow” whom
May was about to marry, and for their possible children.
Mrs. Carney’s moral outlook was the result of
the hard school in which she had been educated. As
for her willingness to saddle a hardworking young man
with her sickly daughter, this was, after all, only her
duty as a “good mother.” It would have been hard
to make Mrs. Carney see anything wrong in her attitude
toward her daughter’s marriage. One has to
admit that what we expected of her as a matter of
course was from her point of view heroic conduct.</p>

<p>In view of the circumstances surrounding these
young lives, it is useless to talk of the “fall” of these
girls. Many of them have never lived on a sufficiently
high moral level to “fall.” With them immorality
is of a piece with the uncleanliness, physical and mental,
in which they have been reared. There was, however,
one important distinction which we learned to
make between the forms of immorality. There was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a88">88</span>
the girl who “solicited” and the girl who did not. One
may have courage to grapple with mere immorality,
but the girl who has been swept into the currents of
commercialized vice is at once allied with secret and
powerful forces which enable this trade to hold its own.
Once during the year we were compelled to stand by
helplessly and see a girl of sixteen slip over the brink
of prostitution.</p>

<p>Carrie Drake, who drifted into the club one evening
with Winnie Hyland, was a tall, white-faced girl, rather
gawky and poorly dressed. She wore a shabby suit,
a very dirty white waist of cheap embroidery, and a
rackety hat which showed the effects of having been
repeatedly rained upon. Carrie’s devotion to this hat
was all the more noticeable because the other girls
seldom wore any. We soon discovered the reason; an
attack of typhoid fever had left her almost bald. Beneath
the hat she wore a reddish-brown wig which was
so thin that it scarcely covered her new growth of stubby
hair of altogether a different shade of brown. She
said she had made the wig of “some puffs,” and that
it had been very good until some girl had tried to
improve it by cutting it. She possessed a low voice
and a courteous manner which she had kept as salvage
from the wreck of her mother’s training.</p>

<p>Winnie Hyland, who brought her to us, was an irresistible
little crippled girl whose faith in the powers of a
social worker was the result of having been gently cared
for all her life by representatives of one social agency
or another. The tubercular hip-bone which she had
developed in early childhood had saved her from the
worst of the harshness and want which prevailed in her
own home. Discovering her friend in search of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a89">89</span>
job she brought her over to the club to one of the
“teachers.”</p>

<p>Carrie was not a hopeful candidate for work. She
was only fifteen, still gaunt from the ravages of typhoid,
grotesque in appearance. Her mother had died when
she was eleven, and she had been promptly taken from
school, which she hated, to do the housework. To appease
the truant officer, she was sent to another school
for a month. Then quietly she dropped out altogether.
An attempt at work in a factory at this age was unsuccessful.
“My aunt told the forelady how I was poor
and hadn’t any mother. So she took pity on me and
let me try.” But she was soon discharged and was
kept at home to take care of her younger brother and
sister, until all three were sent to an institution. Two
months later the father died,&mdash;as Carrie declared and
certainly believed, “of a broken heart.”</p>

<p>After leaving the institution at fourteen, she had
lived with her aunts by spells, quarreling and breaking
away from time to time. For a while she had stayed
with the mother of a friend who found her sitting on
the steps in the rain. She tried places at service, but
she was not a trained houseworker and did not stay
long at any place. Finally she had got a job in a steam
laundry, but while working there she sickened with
typhoid and was sent to the hospital. When she came
to us she was living with an aunt in a furnished room
house, a forlorn, three-story shack on one of the river
blocks. The halls reeked with odors from the corner
saloon. The aunt, her husband, and two children were
occupying a single room when they took the girl in.
There was only one bed. “I told Carrie she could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a90">90</span>
squeeze in,” she explained. “I couldn’t ask her to sleep
on the floor.”</p>

<p>It was slow business finding work for Carrie. She
had to have better clothes. She had to be examined
by a physician, for there were signs of a venereal disease
which would have made her dangerous to fellow-workers
in a factory. These things had been arranged for and
consented to. But before they could be put into effect
and work could be found, Carrie had taken the plunge.
She disappeared without leaving a trace, but soon after
one of the girls reported seeing her on Eighth Avenue,
“in a real wig and a swell new suit.” Immorality was
not new to Carrie, but she had found a way to make
it pay. She was “on the streets.” There followed
an unsuccessful search, inquiries at police headquarters,
of prison officials, of probation officers. We enlisted
the aid of a strong society, but the agent, though
he promised to help, gave us very little encouragement,
saying that such a search was pretty hopeless,
as there were hundreds of girls in similar circumstances
at large in New York.</p>

<p>Carrie slipped out of sight all the more easily because
she had no one “who rightly belonged to her.” When
a girl disappears from a home presided over by a
determined mother, the search which follows is likely
to be a desperate one. Mrs. Mullarkey’s search for
her Fannie was a mixture of folly, shrewdness, and
heroism. Fannie, according to her mother, was “the
best girl you ever saw” till she came to live on the
“Gopher block.” There she “got in” with an older
girl at the factory and began to be tough. She threw
up her job, as did her friend, and the two spent their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a91">91</span>
time in secret ways. At first the mother knew nothing
of Fannie’s being out of work because the girl left home
regularly mornings and came home promptly to her
dinner. But at last the fraud was discovered; there
was a scene, with “hollerin’ and smashin’,” and upon
the heels of it Fannie disappeared. Mrs. Mullarkey’s
fears pointed to a certain house on Eleventh Avenue
where a woman lived who had the reputation of harboring
girls. Not daring to go there alone, she enlisted the
aid of Father Langan, “a rough hollerin’ sort of a man
that the children was all afraid of.” But the woman
would not open even to the Father’s authoritative
knock. Eventually they returned with an officer who
broke down the door. But Fannie was not there after
all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mullarkey’s two aids, the officer and the priest,
could give her no further counsel. But she herself
knew of another resource in the person of a young man,
about twenty-two years old, a gangster and political
scullion, whom she had known from early boyhood. To
him she made her appeal for old acquaintance’ sake.
“For God’s sake, Petey,” she said, “you are the only
one that can get Fannie. Find out where she is.”
Moved by the appeal and nothing loath to show his
power, Petey promised that he would find the girl;
only he stipulated that Mrs. Mullarkey must “leave
Fannie be” when once she had her. Mrs. Mullarkey
agreed and Petey went forth on his quest. In a
couple of hours he returned with the culprit and
commanded her to tell her mother where she had been.
At first she refused; but Petey, once enlisted on the
mother’s side, was a stern and unyielding ally. He
brought out a knife and threatened her, so that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a92">92</span>
poor girl was terrified and stammered forth a confession
of how she and her friend had been staying together in
a furnished room. Mrs. Mullarkey was so outraged
by what she heard that she altogether forgot her promise
to Petey. After he had gone she summoned an officer
and had the girl taken to court. Fannie was locked up
in a cell for twenty-four hours “to cool off.” When
she came up before the judge the following day she
was “as brazen as could be, not a tear in her eye.”
At last, however, she said she wanted to go home, and
the judge placed her on probation.</p>

<p>We knew a sorry scrap of a child, five years old, who
was already getting her instruction. She was a thin,
sharp-featured little creature, uncommunicative, but
very watchful out of her clear, bright blue eyes. Her
clothing, hands, and face were always unclean. She
gave an uncomfortable sense of possessing a great deal
of unnatural knowledge for her age. Her home was a
kitchen with two windows, and two tiny dark bedrooms,
as hopelessly unkempt and dirty as herself. It was the
abode of six people and nine cats. Her father was the
last of three husbands, all of doubtful legal status. Her
mother, who drank heavily on occasion, was unreliable.
“Patsy” was the frequent companion of her sister of
fifteen. This girl, who had an unusual, vivid, and
forceful personality, was alternately sought out by the
fellows of the block and censured with their disapproval.
She ruled Patsy as an autocrat, petting and punishing
her, allowing her to “tag around” and constantly using
her as a go-between. There will be no question of a
“fall” for Patsy. As she was being taught, so in time
she will naturally develop.</p>

<p>With girls from such homes, childhood is the crucial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a93">93</span>
time. It is not temptation, circumstance, or delusion
that gets them into “trouble.” It is the faulty moral
and mental training which simply expresses itself later
in the almost inevitable, natural fashion. A smattering
of conventional morality given by the church or by
school is of little practical force against the tenor of
their lives. “Reform” for such girls does not mean a
return to abandoned ideals and desires. This is hard
to achieve, but what is required here is still more difficult.
It is the graft of new habits and a new outlook.
It is the patient training away from the easy ways into
the strict new law. Even fourteen or fifteen may be
too late an age at which to begin this.</p>

<p>But actual immorality is not the only fruit of the
dingy, sordid happenings which compose so large a
part of the life of this community. There are girls
who grow up in the midst of vicious surroundings with
an inward security against harm. They are as trustworthy
as the most carefully trained and guarded
child&mdash;and hardier. For with them there is truth in
the familiar boast, “I’m able to take care of myself.”
But they pay a price for this fortitude. They are not
taught, cleanly and rightly, straight from the shoulder.
The taint and grime around them reach to their
thoughts and feeling, and they suffer in their conceptions
of life and of human experience.</p>

<p>We hear a great deal of the precocious development
of New York children. It is most noticeable in girls
from homes like these. In spite of the essential helplessness
of their age, they acquire a surface hardihood
which marks them out from normal children. They
have grown up to have a settled distrust of life. They
have a lurking bitterness which may be unavoidable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a94">94</span>
in the adult but which ought never to play a part in
childhood.</p>

<p>Yet, granting all the untoward conditions and influences
which she must face, the problem of our West
Side girl is by no means a hopeless one. Watch her as
she swings through the streets, lovely through all her
tawdriness, fine through all her vulgarity, gentle through
all her “toughness.” Seeing her thus we cannot but
see also her hopeful possibilities, in spite of the sordidness
and evil which have encompassed her.</p>

<p>To strengthen the best elements of the home&mdash;this is
the surest and most fundamental way to help this girl.
The dangers for her family are the most deeply rooted
menace to her. And here they are manifold. We may
safeguard her recreation; we may improve her schooling;
we may regulate her working conditions. But we
must remember that she is seldom to be regarded
entirely as an individual; she is one of a family group,
a unit of a community. Unless she drifts to the streets
she will probably remain so. And whatever can
lighten and beautify the grimy life of the district, or
relieve the intense pressure on family comfort, will
give her a better chance.

<h2 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="large">THE ITALIAN GIRL</span></h2>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">By Josephine Roche</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">From</span> out the big candy factories of the Middle
West Side throngs of workers, one Saturday
night, came hurrying into the December darkness.
Eagerly they turned their steps toward their
tenement homes. Many of them were Italian girls,
and very young.</p>

<p>Across the street from Kohlberger’s candy factory a
child waited, peering anxiously at every group of girls
that left the building. “Lucy!” she called out suddenly.
Three girls stopped and the child ran up to
them crying, “Oh, Lucy, your sister Mary’s got
twins!” Lucy’s shriek of delight was echoed rapturously
by her companions; they caught hold of the
child and besieged her with questions. Several friends
stopped to hear the glad tidings. Then the little group
set out up Ninth Avenue for Lucy Colletti’s home to
see Mary and the new arrivals.</p>

<p>The noise of the elevated trains drowned their voices
and the crowds held them back, but they talked happily
on. After the first excitement of the news had
abated a little, they turned to other matters. “Perhaps
your friend will be at your house, Lucy,” said
one of the girls.</p>

<p>Lucy’s happy look faded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a96">96</span></p>

<p>“No, he won’t.”</p>

<p>“But he’s there at the door every night, and he
goes up the stairs with you.”</p>

<p>“My father’s got no use for him, so I told him ....
Well, what’s the use, we ain’t allowed to do anything,”
she ended sullenly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do like Jennie does, and not let
them know?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“They’d know. They don’t ever let me out at
night, not even to go to the club. It’s just sit around
the house all evening. If you’ve got a husband, he’ll
take you out somewhere. Mary got married when she
was fifteen and after that she went out all the time.
I wisht I was married!”</p>

<p>As they turned from Ninth Avenue west into one of
the Forties a girl and a young man approached them.
“There’s Angelina!” exclaimed Jennie, calling to the
girl. Angelina greeted them warmly. She was thin
and looked delicate, as though she had just recovered
from a severe illness. In answer to the girls’ eager
questions she said that she was better; that she and
Nick were to be married at Christmas and go to live
in the Bronx; that she’d get well fast then. She
asked in turn about the girls at the factory and said
that she missed them.</p>

<p>Angelina was sixteen. Two years before, she had
gone into the candy factory. She started at $3.50 a
week and after a year got $4.00, packing chocolates in
the basement. It was cold there and damp, and in
spite of her heavy sweater and two pairs of stockings
she had contracted a severe cold which lingered on her
lungs. She failed steadily until one day after a bad
fit of “coughing blood” she fainted and had to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a97">97</span>
taken home. She could not go back, although her
mother missed the $4.00 sadly, as her father too was
out of work. But when she was able to be up and
care for the baby and do her mother’s work as janitress,
the latter managed to get cleaning jobs and things
were easier. This last week her father had got employment.
He was washing dishes in a saloon for
$9.00 a week. Now it would be possible for Angelina
to marry. Her friends shared in her happiness with
quick responsiveness, and continued to talk of her
marriage to Nick until the nearness of Lucy’s house
brought them back to the first interesting topic of the
evening.</p>

<p>“My, I’m glad I don’t have to work tonight!”
Lucy exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must work tomorrow!” exclaimed
Jennie. “I just hate going on Sunday. Gee! I don’t
want no candy for a Christmas present!”</p>

<p>Through cold, ill-smelling hallways, the girls trooped
up the four flights of narrow stairs to Lucy’s home.
The gas flame which flickered feebly on each landing
revealed the dirty, crumbling walls. It was the social
hour of the tenements. Fathers were returning
from the day’s toil and the children were welcoming
them. Mothers were cooking the evening meal, whose
various odors mingled in the passage-way with those
of bad plumbing, the common toilets, escaping gas,
wet plaster, and garbage. Half-dressed babies crept
out to the open doors or rolled on the bare, grimy
hall floors, peering with curious eyes through the banisters
at the new arrivals. The little knots of neighbors
gathered about the doorways hailed Lucy with
words of rejoicing. A continuous sound of voices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a98">98</span>
arose, sometimes low and laughing, again, high and
excited, but tinged with the varying cadences and the
finely shaded meanings with which the Italian language
abounds. Accustomed to a life of the greatest intimacy
with relatives and neighbors, the Italians will
sacrifice any comfort to preserve this condition.</p>

<p>In the Collettis’ flat a stream of smiling friends
passed in and out congratulating Mary and touching
with warm brown fingers the babies’ cheeks. Each
drank two tiny glasses of crème de menthe to the health
of mother and children. Four generations lived in that
flat&mdash;a family of eleven. Mrs. Colletti was seated
near her daughter’s bed, nursing her own year-old baby.
Mrs. Colletti’s mother, who had been a midwife in Italy,
tended her daughter and the newborn babies after
the manner in which she had cared years ago for the
peasant women of Calabria. The Collettis were prosperous;
their fruit stand did a good business. All the
family helped. Mrs. Colletti spent every morning at
the stand, and the children were there after school and
at night. They were able to afford a five-room flat
and some pretentious furniture. The front room was
particularly splendid with its brilliant green-flowered
rug, stiff Nottingham curtains, and equally stiff “parlor
set.” Mary’s wedding presents, bright painted
vases, imitation cut glass, enormous feather roses, and
pink celluloid album, were arranged around the room.
Staring likenesses in heavy oil paint of the bride and
groom were the crowning glory of the parlor.</p>

<p>Lucy dropped her pay envelope into her mother’s
lap. Then she and her friends surrounded the sixteen-year-old
mother and told her of the day’s happenings,
of meeting Angelina, and how she was soon to be married.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a99">99</span>
Mary was as eager as the others over the idea
of a wedding and a dance. Indeed she would be able
to go! And she would wear her blue dress, the one she
bought when she “stood up” with Flora at her wedding.</p>

<p>Lucy’s friends promised as they said goodnight, to
explain to the “boss” why she could not come on Sunday
morning for extra work. They ran downstairs out
into the street, and as they passed the steam laundry
on the block, from which came the dull thump of subsiding
machinery, a girl came through the iron gateway.
She was a short, stocky peasant type, but her shoulders
were stooped, her flesh flabby, and she looked far from
strong. She shivered as she came out of the hot,
steaming workroom into the chill December air. The
girls greeted her.</p>

<p>“You wasn’t at the club last night, Rose, so we came
up to see you,” said Jennie.</p>

<p>“No, I never get home till most 9 o’clock on
Fridays and on Mondays. It’s awful busy at the
laundry these days,” Rose explained. “I wisht I was
back at the factory packing peanut brittle. It’s no
joke standin’ foldin’ all day long. My side hurts something
fierce; it wakes me up at night.” The group
walked along arm in arm toward the tenement in
which Rose Morelli lived.</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Tony?” Jennie asked as they
entered the Morelli flat.</p>

<p>Rose shook her head and glanced at her mother who
sat monotonously jigging a dull-looking baby on her
lap. At the mention of her son’s name she raised her
great, heavy eyes and spoke to Rose in Italian. Then
she dropped them again and the tears ran quietly down
her face. Tony was the oldest of the family, the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a100">100</span>
boy, and he had run away to Florida six weeks before.
He had been led to do so by another boy&mdash;a bad boy.
The Morellis always explained that it was not Tony’s
fault; he was a good boy but he had got tired of working
for the butcher. He had written them a postal
from Jacksonville saying that he was having a grand
time and was stable boy on the race track. But no
further word had come. They did not know where he
was. But the mother had not given up hope that he
would come back, though each day she grew thinner
and the heavy marks under her eyes grew darker. She
watched on the fire escape each night, peering down the
street for Tony’s familiar figure. Now, as she wept
for him, she drew the baby to her and kissed it passionately.</p>

<p>The baby was not her own. It was a little Jewish
foundling she had taken from the “Home” to nurse
when her last baby died seven months ago. Four children
had died before that when “so leetle.” Over the
mantelpiece hung a large, shiny photograph of the last
baby lying in its casket. The, casket had been very
expensive, but it had been a great comfort to the mother
to put so much money into it, quite unconscious that
the living children were paying its heavy price in
lowered health and vitality.</p>

<p>The Morellis’ three rooms had none of the air of
prosperity that characterized the Colletti home. They
were bare, and would have been dingy except for the
bright bedspread, the gayly colored wall decorations,
and advertising calendars, pictures of the royal family,
the pope, the saints, and the Holy Virgin. Under this
last a candle burned, an offering for Tony’s return. In
the tiny dark box of a room back of the kitchen a cot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a101">101</span>
and two chairs served Rose and the two younger girls
as sleeping accommodations. A shakedown in the
kitchen had been Tony’s bed. It was still there, unused.
No one else would have thought of sleeping in
it. It would have been an acknowledgment that he
might not need it again.</p>

<p>As Rose went on talking of their “trouble” to her
friends, they responded with quick sympathy. They
lamented with the Morellis as sincerely as they had
rejoiced with the Colletti family. They felt with Rose
as keenly and genuinely as with Mary and Lucy.
Sympathy is the keynote of the Italian community.
It binds together not only members of the same family
but relatives of all degrees, friends, fellow-tenants,
speakers of the same dialect, those from the same Latin
town. It extends to the little foundling, the tiny
boarder, whose frequent presence in the home is such
sad evidence of the high infant mortality in the Italian
families. The $10 which the foster mother receives
from the institution as board money does not prevent
her from loving her little nursling with the same passionate
abandon with which she loves her own.</p>

<p>Whether a girl comes from the higher income group
like the Collettis, whose home runs the whole depth of
the house and has circulation of fresh air, or from the
group that feels the pressure of bare living in three
choking, dark rooms as do the Morellis, she is touched
by the same deep influence of family bonds and customs.
A tying-up of the individual with the group, an identity
of interests with those of one’s kin&mdash;these are the factors
which dominate the lives of the family into which the
Italian girl is born and which present a valiant front to
the forces of personal independence that meet her in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a102">102</span>
her American life, at school, in industry, and in recreation.</p>

<p>The claims of the school weigh little against the claims
of the family. While she is a little girl in the grades,
having difficulty perhaps with her lessons, the disadvantage
to her of being “kept out” a few days does not
weigh an instant against some temporary family need in
which she may be of help. Illness, financial loss, trouble
of any kind, not merely in her own home but in that of
an aunt or uncle, keep many a young girl out of school
if only to lament with the afflicted.</p>

<p>Let us glance into the Belsito kitchen on a winter
evening after Adelina Belsito has been absent from
school for a week. Over at the school the teacher’s
register shows that this last week’s defection is only the
latest of a long series of absences on the part of “Belsito,
Adelina.” On this particular evening a number of
friends are collected in the kitchen; their sympathetic
and concerned expressions show that they are discussing
some grave and anxious matter. Presently there enters
upon the scene the school visitor. Will she not be
seated and have a glass of wine and Adelina will tell the
long story of the family’s misfortunes.</p>

<p>Illness, accident, death, and loss of savings have
followed each other in rapid succession, topped now
by the burning of a stable and the loss of Mr. Belsito’s
two draft horses, the sole capital of the family. Angelina
tells the story eagerly in great detail, Mrs. Belsito
nodding mournfully at times and adding to her
daughter’s account. The father is absent because he is
out looking for more horses. He has borrowed money
from a friend who is “rich” and the family is anxiously
waiting to know his luck. Presently he comes, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a103">103</span>
children running to him and clinging to his legs. No,
he has not been able to find horses; all cost too much;
there is nothing, nothing to be had. He clasps his head
with his hands and sits with it tragically bowed. Fresh
commiseration arises from the gathering, and animated
suggestions are offered.</p>

<p>Adelina must go to work. That is the consensus
of opinion. But upon inquiry, the school visitor
learns that Adelina is not yet entitled to working
papers, being only in the fourth grade, although nearly
fifteen. No, she does not like to go to school; she did
like it until a year ago, but lately there has been “so
much trouble” that she has been often absent. Of
course she has not gone this week! After her father’s
horses had burned! Adelina lifts surprised, hurt eyes
at the question, though she is not able to explain just
what aid she has been able to give by staying at home.
And they have been sending her cards from the school,
the last one demanding that her father come before the
principal and explain her absence. Adelina and her
family find this very hard and unjust “when there is
so much trouble.” Besides, the father could not go; he
had to look for horses. The father lifts his head and
speaks to the girl in Italian. Presently she explains,
“My father say he have it in his head what he do for
you if you speak to the principal for me.”</p>

<p>And through the slight service which the “school
lady” later rendered, the Belsitos became her fast
friends.</p>

<p>In the Ruletti home down the block there is trouble
of another kind. This time it is the mother’s grief which
the daughter shares. Mrs. Ruletti is a slender, bent
little woman in black. She is not over thirty-three but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a104">104</span>
her deeply lined face looks all of fifty. Just home from
work, she snatches up the baby and kisses it passionately,
murmuring to it in Italian. She weeps as she
talks. Lucrezia Ruletti explains, “They’re going to
take it back; they wouldn’t let her keep it any longer
and she feels just like she did when our baby died.”</p>

<p>“Take it back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to the ‘Home.’ Bennie isn’t our real
brother; he’s a foundling. You see, when the last baby
died in the winter my mother took Bennie from the
Home and now we all love him and they want to take
him back.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ruletti breaks in. “They say to me, ‘You have
no milk now, bring Bennie back.’ But I feed him bread,
meat, oh! he can eat soon. I no want him to go; like
loosa my own baby.”</p>

<p>In the Italian household the daughter of fourteen is
expected to bear a full share of the mother’s responsibilities.
She keeps the house, cooks, washes, dresses and
disciplines the children. Laura Tuzzoli, with her old
little face and her maternal air, is a not unusual type.
Going to call for the first time I paused before the tenement,
uncertain as to their floor. A group of dark-eyed
children around an ash can nearby watched me curiously.
One tiny four-year-old flashed a quick smile of
friendliness and a brilliant glance from her black eyes,
then edged a little away from her companions. Asked
where Laura Tuzzoli lived, she straightened her slight,
ragged shoulders and informed me that she was also a
“Tuzzoli.” She slipped her mite of a hand into mine
and led me up the dirty, unsteady stairs to “our house.”</p>

<p>There the fourteen-year-old sister was presiding in
the mother’s absence. She had just begun to bathe the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a105">105</span>
one-year-old baby, having finished cleaning their three
rooms. The windows had been washed as had the gilt-framed,
cracked mirror which hung proudly in the space
between them. On a shelf beneath a picture of the
Virgin stood a clean jelly-glass filled with water on which
floated a cork bearing a freshly lighted candle.</p>

<p>Presently little Lizzie Tuzzoli came in from school
carrying her books and papers for “home work.”
Fourteen-year-old Laura put her through a rapid fire
of questions about her behavior and whether she had
“made up” with a certain Mamie. Lizzie suddenly
dived into her bag and produced from it a wonderful
pink pencil of the screw variety. Pride of possession
shone in her eyes as she displayed it.</p>

<p>“I got it off Lena Perella,” she announced. Laura
seized the pencil, touched it carefully, then gave Lizzie
a sharp look. “Did she <i>give</i> it to you?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Lizzie squirmed a little. “Yes. She&mdash;I found it
and didn’t know it belonged to her, and Carrie Bussi
said Lena didn’t want it anyway, so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Laura handed the pencil back with a scorching glance
and a dictum whose tone permitted no rejoinder,
“You take that back to school tomorrow and give it to
Lena, <i>d’ye hear</i>?” Then she became the gracious
hostess again.</p>

<p>The bond between Zappira Blondi and her mother
was of another sort. When Zappira was twelve years
old her father had sailed away to America leaving his
family in the little village near Naples to wait until he
could earn a home for them in the new country. But
work was harder to find than he expected. After a
year’s absence he wrote a letter home filled with discouragement
and reporting dreary failure. Zappira,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a106">106</span>
who was the oldest of the children, shared in her
mother’s keen disappointment. The two put their
heads together and laid a plan whereby they could earn
their passage. The mother borrowed a sum of money
sufficient to stock a small store in their village. This
she and Zappira proceeded to conduct so successfully
that at the end of the year the small debt had been repaid
and the passage money laid aside. Their venture
had been kept a secret from the father, and when they
were all ready to make the journey they wrote him the
good news and named the date when he should meet
them at Ellis Island. Great was the joy of the family
at being together, but hard work still lay ahead of these
brave women. They took two small rooms in Mott
Street, and for a year mother and daughter worked in a
factory, eking out a bare living. The girl was now
sixteen, old enough to be married, and though the
family could ill afford to lose her wages her father did
not fail in what he considered his duty. He soon found
a husband for her. Although so young, Zappira had,
through years of close partnership with her mother,
already acquired many of the sober qualities of middle
age.</p>

<p>The unity of the Italian family has an economic as
well as an emotional basis. Father, mother, and
children often form a single industrial unit. “I works
for me fader,” says the urchin whom you meet on the
stairs carrying a pail of coal to a customer. Visit the
Sabbio family and you find Mrs. Sabbio presiding at the
bar in a small saloon. In response to your question
whether her husband owns the saloon, she answers,
“Both of us, we work together.”</p>

<p>In the dark, damp little coal and ice cellars, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a107">107</span>
cluttered tailor and cobbler shops, the grocery and
candy stores, at the fruit stands, and in the saloons, all
members of the family take a hand and help to bring in
the common income. Stroll along Ninth Avenue and
you may see sometimes one member of the family “on
the job,” sometimes another; at busy times, all are
there. The mother is almost always on duty, delegating
the housekeeping and tending of babies to the daughter
at home. But very often the baby is also in evidence,
and is unceremoniously dumped from his mother’s or
sister’s arms into a perambulator when attention must
be given to a customer.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Italian of this West Side community
makes common financial cause with his relatives and
friends in business enterprises. He is likely to be
in partnership with his father-in-law or one of his
numerous brothers or cousins in the ownership of dray-horses,
of a candy or notion store, or a stand. Whenever
an Italian begins to thrive in any kind of joint
business one may at once be assured that his relatives
are “in on it.” And one may be equally sure that in
times of hard luck or slack work the temporary deficit
of the family will be met by relatives and friends.
This is taken as a matter of course. “In Italy everybody
helps everybody else” is the answer you receive
if you express surprise. If the head of the household
falls ill, the neighbors drop in daily to see how he is,
and rarely does one leave without first slipping into the
sick man’s hand a nickel, a dime, or perhaps a quarter.
Not the slightest thought of charity is entailed by the
act, either in the giver’s mind or the receiver’s. It is
understood, however, that the act of kindness will be
reciprocated when occasion arises.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a108">108</span></p>

<p>When the social worker visits such a home and notes
that the signs of real want are lacking, in spite of the
fact that the sole income is the $4.00 or $5.00 a week
which the daughter earns, the suspicion arises that these
people must have profited in business before the father’s
illness and put by more than they will admit. Then
the next-door neighbor enters, a coin is dropped quite
openly on the bedcover, and the social worker departs
with a deeper insight into the ways and character of
the Italian. Small wonder that charitable societies of
this district have comparatively few Italian families in
their charge.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> So common is the feeling of loyalty
and responsibility among them that it is like the old
tribal sense of oneness, an entire merging of the personal
in the group interest, and the group’s bearing as
its own the burden of the individual.</p>

<p>The protection and watchfulness of the family are
constantly about the girl. And the family circle
from which surveillance proceeds is usually intact unless
death has entered it. Only in rare cases is a “broken
home” the result of desertion. The Italian does not
abandon his wife and family, nor is his relation to his
children that of breadwinner only. He shares with the
mother the intimate care and close watchfulness over
them. It is always “I ask my father” with these young
Italian girls, and in spite of the over-strictness which so
many of them resent and from which they take refuge in
deception, there is between the Italian father and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a109">109</span>
daughter a close degree of companionship seldom found
in Americans of their position. Perhaps this is due
to the fact that he is more in touch with American
life than the shut-in Italian mother, whose life is
almost wholly occupied with child-bearing and child-burying.</p>

<p>The eagerness of most Italian parents for the arrival
of a daughter’s fourteenth birthday strikes one with no
little pathos when one bears in mind how pitifully small
is the equipment of the child at that age grown up in
so restricted an environment. The girl herself is as
eager to go to work as her parents are to have her. She
takes it for granted that she should help in the family
income. Carlotta gets a job not because she feels the
need of self-support as an expression of individuality,
of self-dependence, but because she feels so strongly
the sense of family obligation. Lucy Colletti turned
her weekly wages into the more generous family income
as readily and unquestioningly as Rose Morelli gave
hers to meet the needs of bare subsistence.</p>

<p>The West Side Carlotta is not a recent immigrant.
Her family came through Ellis Island probably as much
as ten years ago,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> settling first in one of the lower and
more congested districts of New York. Later they
moved up to this district, attracted by reports of
cheaper rents or simply following, as is the Italian way,
relatives already there. Her father is probably a
naturalized citizen.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the exotic community in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a110">110</span>
Italian lives and his loyalty to Latin traditions, ten
years of New York are bound to leave their mark.
This is particularly true of the West Side Italians, so
many of whom carry on a petty but independent business.
Owning a fruit stand, a coal cellar, or a trucking
business is in itself evidence of long residence and some
Americanization.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> “The Italian with the stand&mdash;eh, he
is well off&mdash;long time here,” is a common remark among
his compatriots.</p>

<p>Other signs of long residence on the West Side are
the changes in names. Not only does “Lucrezia”
become “Lucy”; “Dominica,” “Minnie”; “Giovannina,”
“Jennie”; “Fortunata,” “Nettie”; “Francesca,”
“Fannie” and so on, but even the family names sometimes
suffer a change. The “Aquinas” become the
“Quinns,” the “D’Adamos” become the “Adamses.”
The old names to which still cling some of the
grandeur that was Rome are often gladly exchanged
for a genuine West Side cognomen.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief evidence of Americanization, however,
appears when the daughter of the family begins
wage-earning. For this she goes directly to the factory.
She does not join the ranks of the Italian women who
form so large a proportion of the out-workers or home
workers of New York City. Only those who are
familiar with the submissive way in which the Old World
Italian women endure industrial exploitation can understand
what a stride toward independence the Italian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a111">111</span>
girl has made by simply working in a factory instead
of at home.</p>

<p>A trade-union organizer and a home-work investigator
were recently discussing the Italian girl of sixteen.
The former had found Italian girls slow to respond
to trade organization and was pessimistic about
their economic future. “They will not progress, nor
can you blame them when you think of the history of
their women in Italy.” “You forget how far these
Italian girls in the factory have already progressed,”
said the home-work investigator. “The Italian women
I know best are doing tenement house work and earning
pitifully low wages because they will not leave their
homes to work in a factory.”</p>

<p>The Italian girl works in the factories nearest home.
These on the West Side happen to be principally candy
factories and laundries&mdash;such as Kohlberger’s, where
Lucy Colletti worked, and the laundry where Rose
Morelli was employed as a folder. Should the factory
move she looks for another nearby. Evil lies in strange
parts. If the neighboring candy factory overworks its
employes, as it usually does during the weeks before
Christmas, requiring night work<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and Sunday work, the
girls and their families regretfully submit to these weeks
of exploitation.</p>

<p>But although economic necessity may force Carlotta
into the factory, it does not make her otherwise more
independent of her family. Her father and mother cling
persistently to the old-country custom of close watchfulness
over her. Parental surveillance may be relaxed
during her hours of work, but it is promptly revived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a112">112</span>
when the day’s work is over. The streets, the dance
hall, even the well chaperoned amusement club are
prohibited; nor may she spend her money on dress or
choose a “fellow” for herself. Italian girls have acquired
to a less degree than American girls the habit
of spending.</p>

<p>But of course this system breeds an occasional rebel.
There was Filamina Moresco, for instance, whose calm
investment of $25 in a pink party dress, a beaver hat,
and a willow plume, was reported as little less than the
act of a brigand. If she had withheld 20 cents out of her
pay envelope from her mother she would probably have
been beaten. As it was, she appropriated $25 and her
high-handedness was her protection. Jennie Polini’s
form of rebellion&mdash;choosing a “fellow” for herself and
“seeing him on the sly”&mdash;was not as successful. The
other girls regarded her conduct with doubt and disapproval,
though they shared all of Jennie’s bitter resentment
against the stern discipline of her parents from
whom she was separated by the old abyss between the
generations, widened and deepened by the disparities
of the old world and the new. The pleasures which the
Italian parents permit their daughter are those which
she may enjoy in their company. She shares in the
celebration of family events which the church recognizes
and dignifies with a ritual; such as a birth, a death, or a
wedding, the seasons of Christmas and Easter, the
saints’ days, and the American holidays. These latter
she interprets in her own way. Angelina Costa informed
her parents on Lincoln’s birthday that the
schools were closed because it was an “American saint’s
day.”</p>

<p>The patriarchal festivals of the Italian <i>contadini</i> are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a113">113</span>
reproduced, however sordidly, in the christening parties,
the wedding dances, and the burial ceremonies of the
West Side. To the daughter of fourteen a wedding
party is the summit of bliss. She lives from wedding to
wedding, treasuring memories of the last one or preparing
for the next, until her own turn comes to be the
central figure. One cannot fancy her stealing away to a
secret marriage as so many of the West Side daughters
are inclined to do. That would be to miss the most
glorious day of her life.</p>

<p>The “school lady’s” invitation to Angelina Marro’s
marriage announced that the wedding dance would
begin at 5 in the afternoon, immediately after the
marriage ceremony. The “West Side Café” had been
engaged for the night’s celebration. Surely a place
with so high-sounding a name must lay claim to considerable
pretension! It was with some disillusionment
that the “school lady” entered a small doorway
and groped her way through a narrow, dingy, and
perfectly dark passage toward a tiny slit of light which
promised another door in the far distance. Repeated
knocks on the panels below this ray finally caused a
slipping of bolts. A huge black Italian appeared at the
opening. Near him stood a countryman. They were
both engaged in getting ready the refreshments, but
they welcomed the intruder. On a big, round table stood
a large tin washtub filled with water for rewashing the
beer mugs after use. Large wooden trays were piled
high with a quantity of sandwiches that one could not
believe any crowd, however large, could consume. An
enormous Italian cheese, plates of Italian cakes, and a
number of crates of beer completed the preparation for
the feast.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a114">114</span></p>

<p>The room may have been 30 by 50 feet; the ceiling
was low and the only means of ventilation were two
small windows at one end which opened on a court.
These were tightly closed, with shades and curtains
drawn. Around the walls were benches and chairs.
At the end opposite the windows were the piano and
chairs for the musicians. The walls were decorated with
cheap prints, a large color print of George and Martha
Washington being most conspicuous among them.
Stretching from the four corners of the ceiling to the
gas chandelier in the middle of the room were strings
of flags, representing all nations, but most of them
were American and Italian.</p>

<p>The bride and groom had not yet arrived, but one of
the bridesmaids, Lucy Colletti, came forward and
greeted the visitor cordially. The bride was having
her picture taken, she explained, but would arrive very
soon. The room began to fill up with relatives and
friends of the married pair. There was no dressing
room. All the wraps were piled together on the top
of a high narrow wardrobe. One of the men stood on a
chair and threw on top of the fast growing pile the
additional coats, hats, and furs.</p>

<p>Guests of all ages, from grandparents to toddling
children, continued to arrive in parties. Suddenly the
outer door opened and the young bride and groom
entered. There were cries of welcome, a burst of hand-clapping,
and a general rush for the pair. The dark,
frail little bride in her elaborate costume looked like a
child playing at “dressing up.” The fine net gown and
veil, the white slippers and gloves, must have meant
months of saving and stern denials of necessities. She
was only sixteen, and Nick, who walked beside her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a115">115</span>
bearing his head like a young prince instead of the
young butcher’s helper that he was, had barely turned
nineteen. One could not but reflect that if he had been
living in Gramercy Park instead of on the West Side he
might now be receiving his high school diploma instead
of assuming the burden and responsibility of a family.
And the little bride might be heading the freshman
basketball team with years of care-free development
ahead of her, instead of facing the imminent trials of
child-bearing with the probable addition of factory
labor.</p>

<p>The wedded pair made their way down the hall to
the chairs placed for them at the end. The fact most
striking to the outsider was the total lack of self-consciousness
or awkward embarrassment on the part of
either, young as they were, at being the center of attention,
the object of laughing comments and affectionate
raillery from all present.</p>

<p>The bride took her seat behind a table at the end of
the room, removed her flowers and put them in a pitcher
of water, and having carefully arranged her veil was
ready to receive her friends. “Come,” said Lucy
Colletti, “we must go up to the bride.” This ceremony
over, we stood back and watched the children scramble
wildly for the pennies the men tossed up. Although the
musicians were nearly an hour late, no one seemed to
mind. The children raced and played and rolled on
the freshly waxed floor with fearful results to their
clothes.</p>

<p>By the time the music began, the room had grown so
crowded that the dancers were confined to a small circle
in the center. As the evening passed the air became
blue with dust and tobacco smoke, and the physical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a116">116</span>
discomforts of the place increased to the point of general
exhaustion. Yet one could not but take delight in a
scene where enjoyment was so evident and so thoroughly
sincere. Every guest participated; no one was neglected.
Grandmothers were led out for a gay turn by
grandsons who cavaliered their little sisters in the next
dance. Fathers and daughters, sons and mothers, made
light-hearted couples. It was a sight never to be
seen at an American gathering, but common enough
wherever Italians are assembled for any kind of
celebration or enjoyment. In pleasure, as in work,
the family rules.</p>

<p>But weddings and family dances do not come very
often, and other evenings must be spent in the tenement
home under strict guardianship and oversight.
Against this strictness of another land are constantly
beating all the new, free customs of America. The
conflict begins as soon as Carlotta gets her working
papers and takes her place in the factory. Inevitably
the influences of the new life in which she spends nine
hours of the day begin to tell on her. Each morning
and each evening, as she covers her head with an old
crocheted shawl and walks to and from her factory, she
passes the daughters of her Irish and American neighbors
in their smart hats, their cheap waists in the latest
and smartest style, their tinsel ornaments, and their
gay hair-bows. A part of the contents of their pay
envelopes goes into the personal expenses of those girls.
Nor do they hurry through the streets to their homes
after working hours, but linger with a boy companion
making “dates” for a “movie” or an “affair.”</p>

<p>Slowly but surely their example is beginning to have
its effect on the docile little Italian whose life has hitherto
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a117">117</span>
swung like a pendulum back and forth between her
labors at the factory and the duties and restraints of
home. She begins to long for the same freedom that
the other girls enjoy. But freedom does not mean for
her what it means for the American girl, trained in
a different school from the beginning. She has not the
same hard little powers of resistance, nor can she make
the same truculent boast of being able to “take care of
herself.” She is not able to present the same rough and
ready front to rowdy good times.</p>

<p>Free and easy as are the manners of her American
sisters, they usually draw a line, distinct enough from
their own point of view, at “tough” and “fresh.” The
Italian girl has no idea of where the line is, or whether
these bold-appearing girls really have any standards
of conduct. <i>Her</i> line, the line her people have drawn
for her, is placed well in front of the commonest enjoyments
of the West Side girl. Once it is broken over
by a “lark” with a crowd of boys and girls, then she is,
by her own and her people’s standards, condemned.
Very often, however, she fails to feel the weight of her
old friends’ disapprobation as heavily as might be expected
because she is still accepted by the standards
of the new country, <i>her</i> country. As long as she does
not overstep its particular line, she is safe. But to
her the American line of conduct is blurred and indistinct.
It is determined by conditions which she does
not recognize or understand. The little tragedies and
conflicts of this semi-Americanization are familiar
enough to those who know the Italian girl of some
years’ residence.</p>

<p>It is useless to expect that her young, wholesome craving
for amusement will continue to be satisfied in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a118">118</span>
ways approved by her people. The irresistible lure of
America which has already drawn her parents from the
ancestral plains of Italy continues still to draw her.
She must enter upon her kingdom. But unaccustomed
as she is to the newer ways, the Italian daughter must
be taught intelligently to meet American conditions
and trained in the forms of self-protection which they
necessitate. Her parents cannot do this. They have
themselves still too much to learn. But the community
to which she has come, bringing her all&mdash;her health,
her strength, her industry, and her children&mdash;owes it at
least to her to safeguard the innocent joys of her youth.

<h2 id="APPENDIX_A">APPENDIX A</h2>

<h3 id="ECONOMIC_CONDITION_OF_THE_FAMILIES" class="caption">ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE FAMILIES</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Our</span> 65 girls came from 55 different families.
Forty-one of these families had at some period
in their lives been aided, or investigated,
or disciplined by some sort of private philanthropic or
protective agency. Of these, all but one had records
with some relief agency. In a very few cases the
Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor
and the Charity Organization Society records show
that the family received no relief, but only visitation
and advice. Usually, however, actual relief was given.
Thirty-nine had records in the registration bureau of the
Charity Organization Society. Eleven had Charity
Organization Society records only; 15 had records with
the Association for Improving the Condition of the
Poor only; one had been helped only by the church.
Thirteen had records of relief from or intervention by
more than one society; as, the Association for Improving
the Condition of the Poor and the St. Vincent de
Paul Society, or the Charity Organization Society and
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
or again and again both the Charity Organization Society
and the Association for Improving the Condition
of the Poor. One had been under the care of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
and the Board of Health.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a122">122</span></p>

<p>Often, of course, families such as these must turn to
an agency for help only in time of crisis; and when the
crisis is past and the aid they have received has put
them on their feet again, they no longer need support.
Such, at least, is the ideal of “family rehabilitation.”
Of a different sort are the cases of chronic, wasting
poverty and misfortune, which no charitable aid can
ever render self-supporting. These are the poor who
are always with us; and it was to this group, we found,
that most of our families belonged. In analyzing the
relief cases, it seemed to us that where a family had been
under the care of an agency for less than two years it
could be put in the former group, where relief was given
because of emergencies. Of the 40 cases, 10 were in
this class. The other 30 had records for two years or
more; and of these 30 cases, 17 had records for two years
and less than six years, and 13 for six years or more.
The average period of intermittent care for the 30
families whose relief records extended over more than
two years was nine and a half years. The average is
startling enough, but a few cases stand out as more
startling than the rest. One family had applied for
aid in 1899 and the case had been “closed” and re-opened<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
at intervals ever since. One record extended
from 1892 to 1908, one from 1895 to 1911. One
case had been opened and closed eight separate times
since 1899.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that no figures can be given
to show the help these families had received from private
sources; clothing from women for whom the mothers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a123">123</span>
had done day’s work or washing, money for rent or
doctor’s bills from relatives, food from neighbors,&mdash;all
these things help stave off the dreaded appeal to
“charity.”</p>

<p>We have tried to analyze the immediate causes of
need at the time the family was first referred to the
relief society. The first application is the most significant,
for after help has been obtained once, it is
likely to be sought again. Of our 40 relief cases, one
family had been deserted by the chief wage-earner, in
five he was dead, and in 34 the wage-earner was living.
Very few of the first applications, therefore, were due
to the death of the father.</p>

<p>The number of children born to the family, whether
living or dead, often determines the extent of its
poverty,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and contributes to the necessity for relief.
We have estimated, roughly, that three or four living
children was the average for these 40 families at the
time of the first application. In some cases there was
only one child, but in many cases there were six or
seven. The records do not tell us how many had been
born, nor how many had died, thus adding their quota
to the family’s share of illness, expense, and sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
In the cases that were opened and closed again and
again we find that child after child was born after the
family was far below the line of self-support,&mdash;six or
eight or 10 children born into homes that could support
in decency only one or two at most. But “too many
children” never appears as the cause of an application
for relief in the records of a charitable society.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a124">124</span></p>

<p>It is true that need is rarely due to any one circumstance.
Usually where one kind of misery exists, other
kinds are found also.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The most common causes that
the records for this group of 40 show were lack of
work, casual work, illness, or drink; and these were
combined and coupled together in story after story.
Taking in each case what seems to have been the
chief immediate cause, though we cannot claim that
our division is strictly accurate, we found that in five
cases the need was due primarily to illness; in three
primarily to drink; in 10 the causes were scattering
or could not be ascertained; in 22 the distress was
due most of all to lack of work. Time and again
the entry appears: “The father has been out of work
for ten weeks”; or “It is the slack season in the man’s
trade and he has been unable to get a steady job for
three months”; or “The mother has recently been
confined and the father has been out of a job for
several weeks and there is no food in the house.” It
is repeated over and over&mdash;out of work, out of work,
out of work&mdash;till we can only wonder that drink and
despair do not more inevitably accompany the loss of a
job. These were the conditions that brought 40 of our
families to the point of seeking relief at various times in
their lives.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to judge the usual standing of our
group entirely by these records of the families which
had sought relief. We have therefore taken a kind of
cross section of all the families of our 65 girls to show
their earning capacity and general economic status at
the date when our acquaintance with them began. Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a125">125</span>
these 55 families, only 21 were normal groups. By
this we mean that the father and mother were both
living, that they were together, and that the father
was physically able to be the wage-earner and the
mother the housewife. The other 34 were “broken”
families. In 15 the father was dead, in six the mother
was dead, and in three both father and mother were
dead. In one the father had deserted, and in one the
mother was in prison. In four of them there was a
stepmother or stepfather. In eight families the father
was incapacitated, either by old age or illness, so that
he was not able to be the chief wage-earner.</p>

<p>In 29 of our 55 families, the mothers were wage-earners.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
In nine of these, the father was dead; in
six, he was incapacitated; in 14, the mother worked because
the father’s income was not enough to support
the family without her aid. Where the father was dead
or disabled the mother’s work was more constant and
regular than where she worked to supplement the husband’s
earnings. Of these 29 mothers, 10 went out
for “day’s work” sometimes only one or two days a
week. Ten worked more regularly, washing or scrubbing
several days a week, sewing at home, and so on.
Thirteen were janitresses of the tenements in which
they lived. Payment for this service varies from $3.00
off on a month’s rent to the whole rent and $1.00 besides,
depending on the size of the house or houses
cared for. Four of the janitresses also took in washing
or did other work.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the very presence of
these women on our list means that they were mothers
of adolescent girls and of families of children averaging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a126">126</span>
about five in number. Considering this we realize
more clearly the truth of their saying, “It’s hard bringin’
children up in New York.” More than half the mothers
of our girls were forced to do other work than that of
caring for a good-sized family.</p>

<p>The explanation of this situation is found in the low-paid
unskilled work done by the girls’ fathers. Of the
40 living fathers and stepfathers, we can give the
occupations of 34.</p>

<p>Very few of these occupations are what can properly
be called skilled work, many of them are extremely
irregular and casual, and many of them pay less than a
living wage.</p>

<p>The housing of these families is such as would be
anticipated by those who know them and the facilities
the district offers. There are very few new-law tenements
in this part of New York, and little good can be
said of the best of the old-law houses. Really good
housing is practically unknown. For example, but two
of our 55 families had bathrooms in their apartments.
Many apartments contained small toilet rooms, and
other families used toilets in the hall on the same floor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a127">127</span>
Some still had only an old-fashioned yard toilet. One
house furnished for its tenants a cellar toilet used also
by the men who patronized the ground floor saloon adjoining
it, and this horrible situation made the children
of the house afraid to go to the cellar alone or after dark.</p>

<p>We have housing records for 53 of our 55 families.
Thirty of these lived in apartments containing one or
more dark rooms, with no windows to the outer air, or
to anything more than a tiny air-shaft. Of these 30
families, 10 had one dark room, 18 had two dark rooms,
one had three dark rooms, and one had four dark rooms.
The number of persons in household and the number
of rooms occupied were as shown in the following table:</p>

This item was not secured for three of the 55 families; one
family owned the house in which they lived, and one lived in furnished
rooms, paying $3.50 a week.</p></div>

<p>Life insurance is almost universal in our district
except for families in the most abject poverty. Often
every member is insured, the rate varying from 5 cents
a week for children to 25 cents or more for adults.
One family spent $52 a year for insurance out of a possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a129">129</span>
maximum income of $806 for seven persons.
Another family of seven spent $2.40 a week out of an
income which probably did not average more than $20
a week at the most. The benefit seldom does more than
cover the cost of the funeral, and often barely that.
The baby may have been insured for $30 and the undertaker’s
bill is likely to be $40 or $50. One wife received
$141 at her husband’s death, and the funeral expenses
were $155, leaving a debt of $14, the cost of an illness,
and a family of children to support. Such a funeral,
of course, indicates lack of judgment on the part of
the family, but it must be remembered that from time
out of mind and in all ranks of society, a fine funeral
has meant respect for the dead; and burial in the
Potter’s Field is still a sign of the lowest economic stage
to which a man can fall.</p>

<p>Twenty-five of the 55 families, or nearly half, had
been in the past, or were at the time of our investigation,
affected by excessive drinking on the part of one or
both parents. Of this we were sure, either from records
of philanthropic agencies or from our own knowledge.
Some of the remaining 30 families had no cases of alcoholism,
but concerning others we were unable to
get any definite information. To summarize: In 25
families either the father or mother, or both, were subject
to excessive drinking; in 13 of these the fathers
drank to excess; in four the mothers drank; in eight of
the 25 families both the father and the mother drank.
“Excessive drinking” does not necessarily mean habitual
drunkenness. Such cases are not frequent. On
the other hand, it never means merely taking either
an occasional or a regular drink, unless this is done to
excess. It means at the least drinking of the sort which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a130">130</span>
makes the mother unable to keep her home together
without interference from the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children or makes it impossible for
the father to “hold down” a job. In all 25 of these
cases, the families had relief records.</p>

<p>To sum up, we have divided our families on a basis of
prosperity and poverty as Miss Breckinridge and Miss
Abbott have done in their book on The Delinquent
Child and the Home.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Class I represents the very poor, the “submerged
tenth,”&mdash;the broken family, ill fed, ill clad, ill supported,
aided by charity month after month and year after
year, sick, wretched, truly poverty stricken. To this
class we have judged that 20 of our 55 families, containing
25 of our 65 girls, belonged.</p>

<p>Class II are the poor, those with whom it is a constant
struggle to make ends meet, who seldom have comfort
but who seldom are on the verge of starvation. In
this class we have placed 23 of our families, containing
28 of our girls.</p>

<p>Class III represents the fairly comfortable, those
whose chief wage-earner has steady work or in which
the children are contributing a fair share of the income;
where food is sufficient and overcrowding is not very
great. In this class were 11 of our families, with 11 of
our girls.</p>

<p>Class IV is the very comfortable group, those who can
afford a little more than the minimum of education and
of care for their children, and who are never likely to
know pressing want. In this class there was one family,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a131">131</span>
containing one of our girls. This child’s grandfather
was an early district settler, an Irish builder and contractor.
When he died he left to the mother three or
four tenement houses, in one of which the family were
living, while the rents from the others rendered them,
according to local standards, positively affluent.</p>

<p>Thus, to separate poverty from prosperity, roughly
though it must be, only 12 of the 55 families could be
called comfortable. The remaining 43 families were
poor, some of them wretchedly poor. This condition,
whatever may have been its cause, was the dominating
factor in the lives of all but 12 of our 65 girls.

<h2 id="APPENDIX_B">APPENDIX B</h2>

<h3 id="SCHOOL_ATTENDANCE_DATA">SCHOOL ATTENDANCE DATA</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">To</span> obtain facts regarding school attendance in
the West Side district studied, a special tabulation
for four public schools was made in the
Bureau of Social Research from schedules obtained for
the Committee on School Inquiry of the Board of
Estimate and Apportionment of New York City. Public
Schools Nos. 17, 32, 51, and 127 were the schools
included in the study. The records covered a period
of five months, from February 1, 1911, to June 30,
1911, or practically 100 school days. In the following
table is shown the relation between the absences of
boys and the absences of girls in the four schools
mentioned, and the relation between absences in these
schools and absences in the entire city.</p>

<p>It will be noted that attendance is poorer for the
girls than for the boys. The difference in the average
number of days of absence is about 2.6 days, or approximately
2.6 per cent of the term in question.</p>

<p>Attendance is better in the city as a whole than in
the four schools in the district. But 63.5 per cent of
the children in the schools in the district were absent
less than eleven days, as compared with 67.3 per cent
of those in the city as a whole. The proportion of children
in each of the successive groups representing
longer periods of absence is smaller for the city as a
whole than for the four schools. A comparison of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a133">133</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_a134">134</span>
column for boys with that for girls shows that the low
attendance in the schools studied is due to the relatively
low attendance among the girls. While the percentages
relating to the boys correspond almost exactly
to those relating to all the children of the city, the
percentages for the girls indicate a materially lower
proportion of attendance.</p>

The People’s Institute has undertaken, January, 1914, a neighborhood
work, which will correlate and broaden the various recreation
activities now going on in the Middle West Side. A social
center has been opened in Public School 17, on West Forty-seventh

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">27</a>
Until recently the judges of Special Sessions sat in rotation in
the children’s court. The disadvantages of this system, under which
it was seldom possible for the judge who had first passed upon a case
to follow it to its conclusion, led in 1912 to some modifications in the
direction of more permanent assignments of children’s court judges.
Further improvements were made in 1913. Four judges of the Court
of Special Sessions were designated as children’s court judges, and they
constitute a committee on children’s courts. For the greater part of
the year one judge sits in the children’s court in Manhattan, another
in the court of Brooklyn, and since January, 1914, a third sits on
different days of the week in the courts in Queens, Richmond, and the
Bronx. The fourth is chairman of the committee and sits about
three months in the year in each court. This new arrangement
minimizes rotation in office and permits specialization.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">28</a>
This has been completely changed since a special judge was
assigned to the court. When he is sitting, frequently one and a half
hours will be given to one case alone and there is rarely a day when
there are not two sessions, morning and afternoon. Sometimes the
Manhattan court does not adjourn until 7 p. m.</p></div>

The public is indebted to these volunteers for providing some
probationary care for charges of the court before official probation
was established. As soon as this was done, they were relieved of
the undue pressure under which they had worked without proper
equipment and aid. With the direction and supervision of the
trained official representatives of the court, volunteer co-operation
may now be developed and made highly useful.</p></div>

In March, 1912, as the result of an active campaign, 12 probation
officers who had passed the civil service examination were assigned to
the Manhattan children’s court and made officers of the court, drawing
their salary from the city. In 1913, the number of probation officers
was raised to 20. The effectiveness with which the new probation
work operates is, of course, a subject on which we have no data. The
court still faces the difficulty of having too small a staff for the number
of cases. The Manhattan court has over 10,000 cases under treatment
in the course of a year. In Chicago, the average number of
cases is only about 5,000 and there are 30 regular probation officers
and 30 police probation officers, making a total of 60 persons to handle
this smaller number of cases.</p></div>

Jack Spinner’s mother was required to secure $1,000 bail&mdash;and
fortunately she was able to secure it from the members of her church&mdash;for

taken.</p></div>

“Everybody in the district knows him. Everybody knows where to
find him, and nearly everybody goes to him for assistance of one sort
or another, especially the poor of the tenements. He is always obliging.
He will go to the police courts to put in a good word for the
‘drunks and disorderlies,’ or pay their fines if a good word is not effective.
He will attend christenings, weddings, and funerals. He will
feed the hungry and help bury the dead.

“A philanthropist? Not at all. He is playing politics all the time.
Brought up in Tammany Hall, he has learned how to read the hearts of
the great mass of voters. He does not bother about reaching their
heads. It is his belief that arguments and campaign literature have
never gained votes. He seeks direct contact with the people, does
them good turns when he can, and relies on their not forgetting him on
election day.” Riordan, W. L.: Plunkett of Tammany Hall. A Series

The installation of official probation officers and the adoption of
the new system of records have removed this obstacle to the judge’s
obtaining a comprehensive view of cases and reaching wise decisions.
At the present time a careful preliminary investigation is made by
the probation officer and presented in written form to the judge,
prior to disposition of the case.</p></div>

“parole” system since this chapter was written.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">43</a>
This use of the term “parole” is not strictly correct. “Parole”
more properly applies to the supervision of delinquents after release
from institutions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">44</a>
Since the above was written, a new system of records recommended
by the state probation commission has been adopted by the
court for the use of probation officers. They cover all cases investigated
or on probation since March, 1912.</p></div>

In 1913 a law was enacted for the appointment of three physicians
to examine children for mental defectiveness. As the Civil
Service Commission refused to declare the positions exempt, however,
no appointments were made; but an examination will undoubtedly
be held to make up a list of physicians from which these offices may
be filled. In the meantime the children’s court judge sends many
children to the clinic conducted by Dr. Max Schlapp in connection
with the Post-Graduate Hospital.</p></div>

For truancy records see Appendix, Table 14, <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>. In classifying
the boys studied according to the extent of their truancy, a distinction

delinquent, and those who were included in the inquiry for some other
reason. Data are available for 215 of the 294 boys included in our

These statements of the girls are corroborated by the following
paragraphs from a recent study:
</p>
<p>
“During the past few years aggressive measures have been taken
by different reform organizations aiming to bring about a more
wholesome atmosphere in connection with public dances, especially
those attended by the poorer boys and girls. Proprietors have been
induced to employ special officers to attend the dances and keep
order, prevent ‘tough’ and ‘half-time’ dancing, and protect innocent
girls from the advances of undesirable persons. The duties of
the special officer are difficult to perform. If he interferes too much,
the dancers go to some other place where they enjoy more freedom.
As a result, the honest proprietor who endeavors to conduct a respectable
hall loses patronage, while the disreputable owner makes all
the profit. Again, the young people who attend these balls know
immediately when a person different from themselves appears in the
hall. At once the dance becomes modest and sedate, and the visitor
goes away to report that ‘while conditions are not what they should
be, yet on the whole there is great improvement.’
</p>
<p>
“A social club gave a ball on the evening of March 23, 1912, at a
hall in East 2nd Street. The dancing was very suggestive. The
special officer was entertaining a police sergeant, but neither made
any effort to regulate the actions of the dancers. The next afternoon
another club occupied the hall at the same address, with the
same special officer in attendance. Suddenly, when the dancing
was in full swing, the officer hurriedly rushed among the dancers and
told them to ‘cut it out’ as three detectives had just come in and he
did not want to see the place closed up. A girl, apparently thirteen
years of age, was dancing at the time and the officer put her off the
floor, loudly declaring that the proprietor did not allow young girls
to dance in the hall. Things resumed their former aspect, however,
as soon as the detectives retired.”&mdash;Kneeland, George J.: Commercialized
Prostitution in New York City, pp. 68-70. Bureau of Social
Hygiene. New York, Century Co., 1913.</p></div>

The solidarity of this colony of Italians is not necessarily typical
of other colonies in the city, some of which are known to be well
represented in the charity organization records of their district. One
charitable agency reports, for instance, that in a certain upper East
Side district, nearly 90 per cent of the families applying for relief in
1912-13 were Italian; but Italians undoubtedly formed a large percentage
of the population.</p></div>

Among a group of 86 families visited, the length of residence in
the district was obtained for 79. Of these, 51 families had lived in
the district more than ten years. Eighteen of the 51 had come direct
from Italy and 33 had moved here from other parts of the city.</p></div>

While the men in the group visited were found to be engaged in
an unusual variety of occupations&mdash;laborer, barber, waiter, and 40
others were recorded during a general investigation among Italians
in the district&mdash;most noticeable was the group of well represented
occupations in which the whole family can share.</p></div>

When a family is found to be no longer in need of relief, the case
is technically referred to in the offices of the relief society as “closed.”
If further relief is needed at a later date, it is “re-opened.”</p></div>
